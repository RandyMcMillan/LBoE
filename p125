A few more Shars of toil, and homeward they shall be bound!With much pomp did Anu to Nibiru soar back; gold, pure gold, with him was carried. His new task Utu with cherish performed; Ninurta of Bad-Tibira command retained. Marduk to Lahmu did not return; with his father to the Abzu he did not go.Over all the lands he wished to roam, in his skyship the Earth to comprehend,Of the Igigi, some on Lahmu, some on Earth, Utu was the commander made.After Anu to Nibiru returned, on Earth the leaders great expectations had:With renewed vigor to labor, the Anunnaki they expected.Gold quickly to amass, thereby quicker homebound to be.That, alas, was not what came to pass!In the Abzu, relief, not continued toil, was the Anunnaki's expectation,Now, that the Earthlings are proliferating, let them provide the labor!So were the Anunnaki in the Abzu saying.In the Edin, the tasks were greater; more abodes, more provisions were required.For Primitive Workers, to the Abzu confined, did the Edin heroes clamor.For forty Shars was relief only to the Abzu provided! The heroes in the Edin shouted, Our toil has increased beyond endurance, let us have the Workers too!While Enlil and Enki the matter were debating, Ninurta the decision into his hands took: With fifty heroes an expedition to the Abzu he led, with weapons were they armed.In the forests and the steppes of the Abzu, the Earthlings they chased,With nets they them captured, male and female to the Edin they them brought.To do all manner of chores, in the orchards and in the cities, they trained them.By the doings was Enki angered, by them was Enlil enraged:My expelling of Adamu and Ti-Amat you have overturned! So Enlil to Ninurta said.125
