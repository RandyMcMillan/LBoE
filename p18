By these laws, confusion soon came about; if the Firstborn son not by the First Wife was born, And thereafter by the First Wife a son was born, by law the Legal Heir becoming,Who shall be the successor: the one by the count of Shars firstborn? The one by the First Wife born?The Firstborn son? The Legal Heir? Who shall inherit? Who shall succeed?In the reign of Anshargal, Kishargal as First Wife was pronounced. A half sister of the king she was.In Anshargal's reign, concubines were again brought into the palace.By the concubines, sons and daughters to the king were born.A son by one was the First to be born; the son of a concubine was the Firstborn.Thereafter Kishargal bore a son. The Legal Heir by law he was; the Firstborn he was not.In the palace Kishargal raised her voice, in anger shouting:If by rules my son, by a First Wife born, from succession shall be barred,Let the double seed not be neglected!Though of different mothers, of one father the king and I are offspring.I am the king's half sister; of me the king is half brother.By that my son the double seed of our father Anib possesses!Let henceforth the Law of the Seed, the Law of Espousal overpower!Let henceforth a son by a half sister, whenever born, above all other sons rise to succession! Anshargal, contemplating, the Law of the Seed embraced with favor:Confusion of spouse and concubines, of marriage and divorce, it would be avoided.In their council, the royal counselors the Law of the Seed for succession adopted.By the king's order, the scribes the decree recorded.Thus, the next king by the Law of the Seed for succession was proclaimed.To him the royal name An.Shar was granted. Fifth on the throne he was.Now this is the account of the reign of Anshar and the kings who followed.18
