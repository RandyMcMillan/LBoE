For the maladies relief I have brought, Ninmah to her brothers said.From her pouch a bag of seeds she brought out, seeds in the soil to be sown;A host of bushes from the seeds shall sprout, a juicy fruit they will produce.The juice an elixir shall form, for drinking by the heroes it shall be good.Their ailments it will chase away; happier their mood it shall make!In a cool place the seeds need to be sown, by warmth and water need they nourishing!So did Ninmah to her brothers say.The place that for this is perfect I will to you show! Enlil to her said.It is where the Landing Place was fashioned, where an abode of cederwood I have made!In Enlil's skyship the two of them, Enlil and Ninmah, skyward soared;To the Landing Place in the snow-covered mountains, by the cedar forest, brother and sister went.On the great stone platform the skyship landed, to Enlil's abode they went. Once inside, Enlil embraced her, with fervor he kissed Ninmah.Oh my sister, my beloved! Enlil to her whispered. By her loins he grabbed her, Into her womb his semen he did not pour.Of our son Ninurta word I bring you! Ninmah to him softly said.A young prince he is, for adventure he is ready, to join you on Earth he is prepared!If here you stay, let us Ninurta our son bring over! Enlil to her said.To the Landing Place heroes were arriving, rocketships by skyships to the platform they carried. From the pouch of Ninmah the seeds were obtained, in the valleys soil they were sown,A fruit from Nibiru on Earth to be grown!In the skyship Enlil and Ninmah to Eridu returned.On the way Enlil to her the landscape showed, the Edin's extent to her he showed,From the skies Enlil to her his plans explained.80
