The Earth shook and crumbled, the heavens after the brilliance were darkened;With burnt and crushed stones was the plain of the chariots covered,Of all the forests that the plain had surrounded, only tree stems were left standing.It is done! Ninurta from the skyship, his Black Divine Bird, words shouted.The control that Marduk and Nabu so coveted, of it they are forever deprived!Then to emulate Ninurta Nergal desired, to be Erra the Annihilator his heart him urged;Following the King's Highway, to the verdant valley of the five cities he flew.In the verdant valley where Nabu the people was converting, Nergal as a caged bird to squash him planned!Over the five cities, one after the other, Erra upon each from the skies a terror weapon sent,The five cities of the valley he finished off, to desolation they were overturned.With fire and brimstones were they upheavaled, all that lived there to vapor was turned.By the awesome weapons were mountains toppled, where the sea waters were barred the bolt broke open,Down into the valley the sea's waters poured, by the waters was the valley flooded;When upon the cities' ashes the waters poured, steam to the heavens was rising.It is done! Erra in his skyship shouted. In Nergal's heart there was no more vengeance.Surveying their evil handiwork, the two heroes by what they saw were puzzled:By a darkening of the skies were the brilliances followed, then a storm to blow began.Swirling within a dark cloud, gloom from the skies an Evil Wind carried,As the day wore on, the Sun on the horizon with darkness it obliterated,At nighttime a dreaded brilliance skirted its edges, the Moon at its rising it made disappear.When dawn the next morning came, from the west, from the Upper Sea, a stormwind began blowing,The dark brown cloud eastward it directed, toward the settled lands did the cloud spread; Wherever it reached, death to all that lives mercilessly it delivered;233
