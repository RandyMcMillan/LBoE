Vast lands separated by oceans they recorded, with the Beam That Scans the soils they penetrated.On Nibiru impatience was growing. Can gold protection provide? was the outcry increasing. Assemble the gold, on Nibiru's nearing gold you must deliver! So did Anu Ea command.Repair Alalu’s chariot, for returning to Nibiru make it fit, for the Shar's completion make it ready! So was Anu saying.Ea his father’s, the king, words was heeding; the repairing of Alalu's chariot he was contemplating.As the sky chamber one eve by the side of the chariot they landed,With Abgal the chariot they entered, a secret deed in the darkness to perform.The Weapons of Terror, the seven of them, from the chariot they removed;To the sky chamber they took them, inside the sky chamber them to give hiding.By sunrise Ea with Abgal in the sky chamber soared, to another land was their direction.There, in a secret place, did Ea the weapons hide; in a cave, a place unknown, he stored them. Then to Anzu Ea words of command gave, to repair Alalu's chariot he him directed,For returning to Nibiru to make it fit, by the Shar's completion to make it ready.Anzu, in the ways of chariot, greatly skilled, to the task his labors set;He made its thrusters hum again, its tablets he carefully considered;The absence of the Weapons of Terror he soon discovered!With anger Anzu cried out; Ea of their hiding away gave the explanation:Foresworn is the weapons' use! Ea was saying.Neither in the heavens nor on Firm Lands shall they ever be harnessed!Without them no passage through the Hammered Bracelet is safe! Anzu was saying.Without them, without Water Thrusters, the danger is endurance surpassing!Alalu, of Eridu the commander, the words of Ea considered, to the words of Anzu heed he gave: The words of Ea by the Council of Nibiru are attested! Alalu was saying;But without the chariot's return, Nibiru shall be doomed!60
