In Lagash the Girsu precinct for Ninurta was built, his Black Skybird there was kept.Eninnu, House of Fifty, was the temple-abode for Ninurta and Bau his spouse called;The Supreme Hunter and the Supreme Smiter, weapons a gift of Anu, the Eninnu protected.Where Sippar before the Deluge had been, on top of the mud-soil Utu a new Sippar established.In the Ebabbar, the Shining House, an abode for Utu and his spouse Aya was raised;From there Utu for Mankind laws of justice promulgated.Where because of silt-mud the olden plans could not be followed, new sites were chosen.Adab, a site from Shurubak not distant, for Ninharsag as a new center was made.The House of Succor and Healing Knowledge was her temple-abode therein named;The ME's of how the Earthlings were fashioned Ninharsag in its holy shrine kept.For Nannar a city with straight streets, canals, and wharves was provided; Urim was its name,House of the Throne's Seed was its temple-abode called, the Moon's beams to the lands it reflected.Ishkur to the mountainlands of the north returned, the House of Seven Storms his abode was called;Inanna in Unug-ki resided, in the abode by Anu bequeathed to her she dwelt Marduk and Nabu in Eridu dwelt, in the Edin their own abodes they did not have. Now this is the account of the first City of Men and of kingship on Earth,And how Marduk to build a tower schemed and wherefor Inanna the ME's stole. In the First Region, in the lands of Edin and in the cities with precincts,By their Anunnaki lords the Earthlings handiworks and crafts were taughtBefore long were the fields irrigated, on canal and river boats soon sailed;The sheepfolds and granaries were overflowing, prosperity the land filled. Ki-Engi, Land of the Lofty Watchers, the First Region was called.Then to let the black-headed people a city of their own possess it was decided; Kishi, Scepter City, it was called, in Kishi did the kingship of Man begin.209
