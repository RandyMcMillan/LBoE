Let Alalu be king on Earth, a verdict of the sages awaiting:If Nibiru it will save, let there be a second wrestling; who shall Nibiru rule let it determine! The princes, the counselors, the sages, the commanders heard Ea's words with wonder; Full of wisdom they were, for conflict they solution found.Let it so be! Anu announced. Let Ea journey, let the gold be tested.Alalu a second time I shall then wrestle, let the winner be on Nibiru king!The words of decision to Alalu were conveyed;He pondered them and agreed: Let Ea, my son by marriage, to Earth come!Let gold from the waters be obtained, let it for salvation on Nibiru be tested;Let a second wrestling kingship by me or Anu settle!So be it! Anu in the assembly decreed.Enlil rose in objection; the king's word unalterable was.Ea to the place of the chariots went, commanders and sages he consulted.The mission's dangers he contemplated, how to extract and bring the gold he considered. Alalu's transmission he carefully studied, Alalu for more testings the results he requested. A Tablet of Destinies for the mission he was fashioning.If water be the Force, where could it be replenished?Where on the chariot will it be stored, how to Force will it be converted?A full circuit of Nibiru did pass in contemplations, a Shar of Nibiru in preparations passed. The largest celestial chariot for the mission has been fitted,Its circuit's destiny has been calculated, a Tablet of Destiny has been firmly fixed;Fifty heroes will for the mission be required to journey to Earth the gold to obtain!To the journey Anu his approval gave;The stargazers for the journey the right time to begin then selected.48
