No one his fellow man could see, the ground vanished, there was only water.All that once on the ground stood by the mighty waters away was swept;Before day's end the watery wall, gathering speed, the mountains overwhelmed. In their celestial boats the Anunnaki the Earth were circling.Crowding the compartments, against the outer walls they crouched,What was happening upon the Earth, down below, to see they strained.From the celestial boat in which she was, Ninmah like a woman in travail cried out:My created like drowned dragonflies in a pond the waters fill,All life by the rolling sea wave away was taken! Thus did Ninmah cry and moan.Inanna, who was with her, also cried and lamented:Everything down below, all that lived, has turned into clay!Thus did Ninmah and Inanna weep; they wept and eased their feelings.In the other celestial boats the Anunnaki by the sight of unbridled fury were humbled,A power greater than theirs they with awe those days witnessed.For the fruits of Earth they hungered, for fermented elixir they thirsted.The olden days, alas, to clay have turned! So to each other the Anunnaki said.After the immense tidal wave that over the Earth swept,The sluices of heaven opened, a downpour from the skies upon the Earth was unleashed.For seven days the waters from above with the waters of the Great Below were mingled;Then the wall of water, its limits reaching, its onslaught ceased,But the rains from the skies for forty more days and nights continued.From their perches the Anunnaki looked down: Where there were dry lands, now was a sea of water,And where mountains once to the heavens their peaks raised, Their tops now like islands were in the waters;172
