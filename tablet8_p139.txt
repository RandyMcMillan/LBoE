Weaving of sheep's wool has never before been established!The Anunnaki leaders, Enki and Enlil, Ninmah and Ningishzidda, who the creators were,A Creation Chamber, a House of Fashioning, to establish decided.Upon the pure mound of the Landing Place, in the Cedar Mountains, it was established,Near where the elixir seeds by Ninmah brought were planted there was the Creation Chamber established,There was the multiplying of the grains and of the ewes on Earth begun.Of Ka-in for sowing and reaping Ninurta was the mentor,Of Abael the arts of ewe and lamb rearing and shepherding Marduk was the mentor. When the first crops were reaped, when the first sheep matured,Let there be a Celebration of Firsts! Enlil a decree proclaimed.Before the assembled Anunnaki the first grains, the first lambs were presented,At the feet of Enlil and Enki Ka-in, by Ninurta guided, his offering placed;At the feet of Enlil and Enki Abael, by Marduk guided, his offering placed.Enlil to the brothers gave a joyful blessing, their labors he extolled.Enki his son Marduk embraced, the Iamb for all to see he raised,Meat for eating, wool for wearing to Earth have come! Enki said.Now this is the account of the generations of Adapa,And the killing of Abael by Ka-in, and what thereafter transpired.After the Celebration of Firsts was over, sullen was Ka-in's face;By the lack of Enki's blessing greatly he was aggrieved.As to their tasks the brothers returned, Abael before his brother was boasting:I am the one who abundance brings, who the Anunnaki satiates,Who gives strength to the heroes, who wool for their clothing provides!Ka-in by his brother's words was offended, to his boasting strongly he objected:139
