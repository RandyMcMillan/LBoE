At the Place of the Chariots multitudes gathered, to bid farewell to the heroes and their leader did they come.Bearing Eagle's helmets, carrying each a Fish's suit, the heroes the chariot one by one entered. The last to embark was Ea; to the gathering he bade farewell.Before his father Anu he knelt down, the king's blessing to receive.My son, the Firstborn: A far journey you have undertaken, for us all to be endangered;Let your success calamity from Nibiru banish; go and in safety come back!So did Anu to his son speak a blessing, bidding him farewell.The mother of Ea, the one called Ninul, to her heart embraced him.Why, after by Anu as a son to me you were given, did he with a restless heart you endow? Go and come back, the hazardous road traverse safely! to him she said.With tenderness Ea kissed his spouse, Damkina he without words embraced.Enlil with his half brother locked arms. Be blessed, be successful! to him he said.With heavy heart Ea the chariot entered, to soar up the command he gave.Now this is the account of the journey to the seventh planet,And how the legend of the Fishgod who came from the waters was begun.With heavy heart Ea the chariot entered, to soar up the command he gave.The commander's seat by Anzu, not by Ea, was occupied; Anzu, not Ea, was the chariot's commander;He Who Knows the Heavens his name's meaning was; for the task he was especially selected. A prince among the princes he was, of royal seed his ancestry he counted.The celestial chariot he deftly guided; from Nibiru it powerfully soared, toward the distant Sun he it directed.Ten leagues, a hundred leagues the chariot was coursing, a thousand leagues the chariot was journeying.Little Gaga came out to greet them, a welcome to the heroes it was extending. To blue-hued Antu, the beautiful enchantress, it showed the way.49
