At first those left behind journey safely! shouted, then muted were the cries.After the launchings toward Nibiru completed were,The turn of Marduk and the Igigi with Earthling spouses came;Marduk them all on the Landing Place assembled, a choice to them he gave:With him and Sarpanit and two sons and the daughters to Lahmu go, there the calamity outwait,Or to distant mountainlands on Earth disperse, a haven from the Deluge to find.Enlil then of those who remained took account, by groupings to them chariots he assigned.Ninurta to the mountainlands beyond the oceans Enlil directed on Earth's rumblings to report;To Nergal and Ereshkigal, the task the Whiteland to watch Enlil assigned;To guard against an onrush of Earthlings, to Ishkur the task Enlil gave,To bar access, barrier and bolt to erect and bolster.Of all preparations Sippar, the Place of the Celestial Chariots, was the center;To Sippar Enlil the Tablets of Destinies from Nibru-ki moved, a temporary Bond Heaven-Earth was there established.His brother Enki Enlil then addressed, to him he was thus saying:However if ever the calamity might be survived, let all that had happened be remembered.Let us tablets of records in Sippar, in the depths of the Earth, safely bury,Let what from one planet on another done in days to come uncovered be!Enki his brother's words with approving accepted. ME's and other tablets in golden chests they stored,In the depths of the Earth, in Sippar, for posterity they buried.Thus ready, for the signal to depart the leaders awaited,The approach of Nibiru in its great circuit with apprehension they watched.It was at that time of anxious waiting that Enki his sister Ninmah addressed,To her was Enki thus saying:In his preoccupation with the Earthlings, of all other living creatures Enlil lost attention!164
