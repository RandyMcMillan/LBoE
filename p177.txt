The chest that Ninagal had carried he unveiled, its surprising contents to all he announced:The life essences and life eggs, in the wombs of the four-legged animals from Ziusudra's boat can be combined,Sheep for wool and meat will multiply, cattle for milk and hides will all have,Then with other living creatures the Earth we shall replenish!To Dumuzi the shepherding tasks Enki gave, in the task was Ziusudra's middle son assisting.Then to the dark-hued landmass, where his and his sons' domains had been, Enki his attention turned.With Ninagal, at the confluence of mighty waters the mountains he dammed, Fierce waterfalls to a lake he channeled to let the waters as a lake accumulate. Then the lands between the Abzu and the Great Sea with Marduk he surveyed: Where habitations once were, the river's valley how to drain he considered.At midstream where the river's waters cascaded, an island from the waters he raised.In its bowels twin caverns he carved out, above them from stones sluices he fashioned.From there two channels in the rocks he cut, for the waters two narrows he fashioned,Thus the flowing waters from the highlands coming he could slow or let go faster;With dams and sluices and the two narrows the waters he regulated.From the Cavern Island, the island of Abu, the river's serpentine valley from under the waters he raised:In the Land of the Two Narrows for Dumuzi and the shepherds a habitation did Enki fashion. With satisfaction did Enlil all this to Nibiru words send; with words of concern Nibiru responded: The close passage that Earth and Lahmu affected on Nibiru too much damage caused;The shield of gold dust was torn, the atmosphere was dwindling again,Now new supplies of gold quickly were needed!Fervently to the Abzu Enki went, with Gibil his son to survey and search he journeyed.All the gold mines were gone, by the avalanche of water they were buried.177
