My son! Enki to Marduk responded. To you command was given of the Igigi and Lahmu to be supreme!Alas, my father! to him Marduk was saying. Of supremacy by fate we are deprived! You, my father, are Anu's Firstborn; yet Enlil, not you, is the Legal Heir;You, my father, were first to splash down and Endu establish,Yet Eridu is in Enlil's domain, yours is in the distant Abzu.I am your Firstborn, by your legitimate spouse on Nibiru was I born,Yet the gold in the city of Ninurta is assembled, therefrom to send or to withhold,The survival of Nibiru is in his hands, in my hands it is not.Now to Earth we are returning; what will my task be,Am I to fame and kingship fated, or again to humiliated be?In silence did Enki embrace his son, on the desolate Moon to him a promise made:Of that of which I have been deprived your future lot shall be!Your celestial time will come, a station mine adjoining yours shall be!Now this is the account of Sippar, the Place of the Chariots in the Ed i n,And how the Primitive Workers to the Edin were returned.For many circuits of the Earth, from the Earth were father and son absent;On Earth no plans were implemented, on Lahmu the lgigi were in turmoil.Enlil to Anu secret words conveyed, his concerns to Anu he from Nibru-ki beamed:Enki and Marduk to the Moon have gone, for countless circuits there they are staying.Their doings a mystery are, what they are scheming is not known;Marduk the way station on Lahmu has abandoned, the Igigi are agog,By dust storms has the way station been affected, what damage there is to us is not known. The Place of the Chariots in the Edin must be established,122
