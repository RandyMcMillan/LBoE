Adapa, highly intelligent, becomes the first Civilized Man Adapa and Titi mate, have two sons: Ka-in and AbaelTHE SEVENTH TABLETTo the Abzu, away from the Edin, let them be expelled!So did Enlil the command decree; from the Edin to the Abzu Adamu and Ti-Amat were expelled.In an enclosure among the trees Enki them placed; to know each other he left them.With joy did Enki see what Ningishzidda had done come to be: With child Ti-Amat was frolicking.Ninmah came the birth-giving to watch: A son and a daughter, twins, to the Earth Beings were born!With wonderment did Ninmah and Enki watch the newborns,How they grew and developed was a marvel; days were as months, months to Earth years accumulated.By the time Adamu and Ti-Amat had other sons and daughters, the first ones were by themselves procreating!Before one Shar of Nibiru had passed, the Earthlings were proliferating.With understanding were the Primitive Workers endowed, of commandments they were comprehending;To be with the Anunnaki they were eager, for food rations they toiled well,Of heat and dust they did not complain, of backbreaking they did not grumble;Of the hardships of work the Anunnaki of the Abzu were relieved.The vital gold to Nibiru was coming,Nibiru's atmosphere was slowly healing;Earth-Mission to the satisfaction of all was proceeding.Among the Anunnaki, Those Who from Heaven to Earth Came, there was also espousing and procreation.The sons of Enlil and Enki, from sisters and half sisters, from healing heroines, took spouses.114
