For the fifth Shar, for the sixth Shar the phenomena gained strength,On Nibiru the savants an alarm raised, of calamities to the king they forewarnings gave:The next time Nibiru the Sun shall be nearing, Earth to Nibiru's netforce exposed shall be, Lahmu in its circuits on the Sun's other side shall a station take.From the netforce of Nibiru Earth in the heavens protection shall not have,Kishar and its host agitated shall be, Lahamu shall also shake and wobble;In Earth's great Below, the snow-ice of the Whiteland its footing is losing;The next time Nibiru the closest to Earth shall approach,The snow-ice off the Whiteland's surface shall come a-sliding.A watery calamity it shall cause: By a huge wave, a Deluge, the Earth will be overwhelmed! On Nibiru great was the consternation, uncertain about Nibiru's own fate,King, savants, and counselors about Earth and Lahmu also greatly worried.The king and the counselors a decision made: for evacuating Earth and Lahmu to prepare!In the Abzu the gold mines shut down, therefrom the Anunnaki to the Edin came;In Bad-Tibira smelting and refining ceased, all gold to Nibiru was lofted.Empty, for evacuating ready, a fleet of fast celestial chariots to Earth returned;On Nibiru the heavenly signs were watched, on Earth the tremors recorded were.It was at that time that from one of the Celestial Chariots a white-haired Anunnaki stepped off, Galzu, Great Knower, was his name.With steps majestic to Enlil his way he made, to him a sealed message from Anu he presented. I am Galzu, emissary plenipotentiary of King and Council, to Enlil he said.By his coming Enlil was surprised: No word from Anu of that did forecome.Enlil the seal of Anu examined; unbroken and authentic it was.In Nibru-ki the message tablet was read, its encoding was trustworthy.159
