Anib the daughter of his younger brother took to be wife; from them onward the succession is in the annals recorded.Who was that younger brother; a son of An and Antu, one of purest Seed?The counselors with wonderment looked at each other.Enuru was his name! Anu to them announced; he was my great ancestor!His spouse Ninuru was a half sister; her son was firstborn; Enama was his name. His wife was a halt sister, by laws of seed and succession a son she bore him.Of pure descent the generations continued, by law and by seed perfect!Anu, after our forefather An, did my parents name me;From the throneship we were removed; from An's pure seed we were not removed!Let Anu be king! many counselors shouted. Let Alalu he removed!Others caution did counsel: Let strife be prevented, let unity prevail!They called in AIa1u, the discovered findings to be told.To the prince Anu, Alalu his arm in embrace offered; to Anu he thus said:Though by different offsprings, of one ancestor we are both descended;Let us live in peace, together Nibiru to abundance return!Let me keep the throne, let you keep the succession!To the council words he directed: Let Anu Crown Prince be, let him be my successor!Let his son my daughter espouse, let succession be united!Anu bowed before the council, to the assembly he thus declared:AIalu's cupbearer I shall be, his successor-in-waiting; a son of mine a daughter of his as bride shall choose.That was the council's decision; in the royal annals it was inscribed. In this manner Alalu, on the throne remained seated.He summoned the sages, savants and commanders he consulted; for deciding he gained much knowledge.25
