Thus was knowledge of the Beginning ascertained, thus did Alalu this knowledge possess. The gold in the Hammered Bracelet was the confirmation,The gold in the Hammered Bracelet of gold in Tiamat's Upper Half was the indication.At the planet of gold Alalu victoriously arrived, hi, chariot with a thunder crashing.With a beam he scanned the place, his whereabouts to discover;Hi, chariot on dry land descended, at the edge of extended marshes it landed.He put on an Eagle's helmet he put on a Fish's suit.The chariot's hatch he opened; at the open hatch he stopped to wonder.Dark hued was the ground, blue-white were the skies;No sound there teas, there was no one to bid him welcome.Alone on an alien planet he stood, perchance from Nibiru forever exiled!To the ground himself he lowered, on the dark-hued soil he stepped;There were hills in the distance; nearby much vegetation there was.Ahead of him there were marshes, into the marsh he stepped; by the waters' coolness he shuddered.Back to the dry ground he stepped; alone on an alien planet he stood!With thoughts he was possessed, of spouse and offspring with longing he remembered; Was he forever from Nibiru exiled? Of that again and again he wondered.To the chariot he soon returned, with food and drink to be sustained.Then deep sleep him overcame, a powerful slumber.How long he slept he could not remember; what awakened him he could not tell.A brightness there was outside, a brilliance on Nibiru unseen.A pole from the chariot he extended; with a Tester it was equipped.It breathed the planet's air; compatibility it indicated!The chariot's hatch he opened, at the open hatch he took a breath.41
