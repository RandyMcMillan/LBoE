As a cloak for protection he the Pulser and the Emitter put on;With a fearsome radiance his head was crowned.On his right he posted the Smiter, on his left the Repeller he placed.The seven winds, his host of helpers, like a storm he sent forth;Toward the raging Tiamat he was rushing, clamoring for battle.The gods thronged about him, then from his path they departed,To scan Tiamat and her helpers alone he was advancing,The scheme of Kingu, her host's commander, to conceive.When he saw valiant Kingu, blurred became his vision;As he gazed upon the monsters his direction was distracted,36
