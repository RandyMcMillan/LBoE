If my face you shall see, surely like all Earthlings you will die!Now reed hut, to my words pay heed:The purpose of the boat, a secret of the Anunnaki with you must remain!When the townspeople will inquire, to them you will so say:The lord Enlil with my lord Enki has angry been,To Enki's abode in the Abzu I am sailing, perchance Enlil will be appeased!For a while a silence followed. Ziusudra from behind the reed wall came,A tablet of lapis lazuli, in the moonlight shining, he saw and picked up;The image of a boat upon it was drawn, notches its measurements gave;Wisest of Civilized Men was Ziusudra, what he had heard he understood.In the morning, to the townspeople he so announced:The lord Enlil with the Lord Enki, my master, angry has been,On that account to me the lord Enlil is hostile.In this city I no longer reside can, nor in the Edin my foot anymore set;To the Abzu, the lord Enki's domain, I will there a-sailing go.In a boat that must quickly be built I will away from here depart;Thereby the lord Enlil's anger will subside, hardships will end,Upon you the lord Enlil abundance henceforth will shower!The morning was not yet gone when the people about Ziusudra gathered,To speedily for him the boat build they each other encouraged.Timbers of boat-wood the elders were hauling, the little ones bitumen from the marshes carried.As woodworkers the planks together hammered, Ziusudra in a cauldron the bitumen melted. With bitumen the boat he waterproofed inside and out,As in the drawing upon the tablet the boat on the fifth day was completed.169
