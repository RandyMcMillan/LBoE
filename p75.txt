The gold from Earth without interruptions to Nibiru bring, perchance gold elsewhere to also find! The counselors, the princes, the savants Anu's plans considered,The salvation of Nibiru in the plans they all a promise saw.Savants and commanders knowledge of the celestial gods perfected,To chariots and skyships a new kind, rocketships, were added.Heroes for the tasks were selected, for the tasks there was much learning.The plans to Enki and Enlil were beamed over, preparations on Earth to hurry they were told.On Earth of what had happened and what to be done is required there was much discussion.Enki Alalgar to be of Eridu the Overseer appointed, his own steps to the Abzu he directed;Where to obtain gold from Earth's bowels he then determined.What heroes to the task are needed he calculated, what tools were required he contemplated:An Earth Splitter with cleverness Enki designed, on Nibiru that it be fashioned he requested,Therewith in the Earth to make a gash, its innards reach by way of tunnels;That-Which-Crunches and That-Which-Crushes he also designed, on Nibiru for the Abzu to be fashioned.Of other matters Nibiru's savants he to contemplate asked.Of matters of health and well-being of heroes the needs he listed.To the heroes Earth's quick circuits were upsetting,Earth's quick day and night cycles dizziness were causing.The atmosphere, though good, was in some things lacking, in others too abundant;Of the sameness of the food the heroes were complaining.Enlil, the commander, by the heat of the Sun on Earth was afflicted, for coolness and shade he was longing.While in the Abzu Enki preparations was making,Enlil in his skyship the extent of the Edin was surveying.75
