Though greater in Shars were the parents, younger than the children they looked!The two sons looked old and bearded; Ninharsag, once a beauty, was bent and wrinkled.All five of them with tears were filled; tears of joy with sorrowed tears were mingled.In skyships were the guests and their hosts to the Edin taken,In a prepared place beside Unug-ki the skyships landed.All the Anunnaki that on Earth had stayed as an honor guard were standing.Hail and welcome!
