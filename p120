The handiwork of the Creator of All in this solitude we can admire! Let us stay, the circuits observe, how the Moon circles the Earth, How the Earth its circuits around the Sun is making!So Enki, by the sights agitated, to his son Marduk was saying.By his father's words Marduk was persuaded; in the rocketship they made their dwelling. For one circuit of Earth, for three circuits on the Moon they remained;Its motions about the Earth they measured, the duration of a month they calculated.For six circuits of Earth, for twelve circuits about the Sun, Earth's year they measured. How the two were entwined, causing the luminaries to disappear, they recorded.Then to the Sun's quarter they attention gave, the paths of Mummu and Lahamu they studied.With the Earth and the Moon, Lahmu the Sums second quarter constituted,Six were the celestials of the Lower Waters. So was Enki to Marduk explaining.Six were the celestials of the Upper Waters, beyond the bar, the Hammered Bracelet, they were:Anshar and Kishar, Anu and Nudimmud, Gaga and Nibiru; these were the six others, Twelve were they in all, of twelve did the Sun and its family make the count.Of the upheavals most recent, Marduk of his father was inquiring:Why have seven celestials in a row places taken? So was he his father asking.Their circuits about the Sun Enki then considered;Their grand band around the Sun, their progenitor, Enki carefully observed,The positions of Earth and Moon therein on a chart Enki marked out,By the motions of Nibiru, of the Sun not a descendant, the width of the great band he outlined. The Way, of Anu, the king, to name it Enki decided.In the expanse of the deep heavens, the stars did father and son observe;By their proximities and groupings was Enki fascinated.120
