Nibru-ki was in the center, a Navel of the Earth by Enlil it was designated,As on circles by their place and distances the olden cities were located,Like an arrow from the Lower Sea toward the mountains pointing they were arrayed.A line on the twin peaks of Arrata, to the skies in the north reaching, he drew,Where the pointing arrow the Arrata line intersected,The place for Sippar, the Earth's Place of the Chariots, he marked out;To it the arrow directly led, it from Nibru-ki was by an equal circle precisely located! Ingenious was the plan, by its precision all were made to wonder.In the eighty-second Shar was the construction of Sippar completed;To the hero Utu, of Enlil the grandson, its command was given.An Eagle's helmet for him was fashioned, with Eagle's wings was he decorated.In the first chariot from Nibiru to Sippar directly come, Anu was traveling;To view for himself the installations he desired, to marvel at what was attained he wanted. For the occasion the Igigi, by Marduk commanded, from Lahmu to Earth came down,From the Landing Place and from the Abzu Anunnaki were assembled.There was backslapping and hailing, a feast and a celebration.For Anu manna, Enlil's granddaughter, singing and dancing presented;With affection Anu kissed her; Anunitu, Anu's Beloved, he fondly called her.Before departing, Anu the heroes and heroines assembled.A new era has begun! So was he to them saying.Supplied directly with the golden salvation, forthcoming is the end of toil!Once enough gold on Nibiru for protecting is piled in storage,The toil on Earth can be diminished, heroes and heroines to Nibiru will return!Thus did Anu the king to the assembled promise, a great hope to them he did extend:124
