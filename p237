Let us lock arms as brothers, as comrades who together challenges on an alien planet confronted!So did Enki to his brother say.And Enlil, grasping his brother's arm, hugged him as well.Shall we meet again, on Earth or on Nibiru? Enki asked.Was Galzu right that we die if we to Nibiru go? Enlil responded. Then he turned and departed. Alone was Enki left; only by the thoughts of his heart was he accompanied.How it all began and how it thus far ended, he sat and pondered.Was it all destined, or was it fate by this and that decision fashioned?If Heaven and Earth by cycles within cycles regulated,What had happened will again occur? Is the Past-the Future?Will the Earthlings the Anunnaki emulate, will Earth relive Nibiru?Will he, the first to arrive, the last to leave be?Beseiged by thoughts, Enki a decision made:All the events and decisions, starting with Nibiru to this day on Earth,To put in a record, a guide to future generations to become;Let posterity, at a time by destiny designated,The record read, the Past remember, the Future as prophecy understand,Let the Future of the Past the judge be!These are the words of Enki, Firstborn of Anu of Nibiru.Fourteenth tablet: The Words of the lord Enki.Written from the mouth of the great lord Enki,not one word missed, not one word added,by the master scribe Endubsar, a man of Eridu, son of Udbar.By the lord Enki with long life I have been blessed.237
