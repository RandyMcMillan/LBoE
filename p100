To the House of Life they returned, to a clean place with brightness shining they led her. In the clean place Ningishzidda to Ninmah the life-essence secrets was explaining,How the essence from two kinds combined can be, he to her was showing.The creatures in the tree cages are too odd, monstrous they are! Ninmah was saying. Indeed so! Enki responded. To attain perfection, for that you are needed!How the essences to combine, how much of this, how much of that to put together, In which womb conception to begin, in which womb should the birth be given?For that your succor and healing understanding are needed;The understanding of one who gave birth, who a mother is, is required!A smile on the face of Ninmah was; the two daughters that by Enki she mothered she well remembered.With Ningishzidda she surveyed the sacred formulas that on ME's were secreted,How this and that were done of him she inquired.The creatures in the tree cages she examined, the two-legged creatures she contemplated.By a male inseminating a female are the essences transmitted,The two entwined strands separate and combine an offspring to fashion.Let a male Anunnaki a two-legged female impregnate, let a combination offspring be born! Thus did Ninmah say.That we have tried, with failures it resulted! to her Enki responded.There was no conceiving, there was no birth!Now this is the account of how the Primitive Worker was created,How Enki and Ninmah, with Ningishzidda assisting, the Being fashioned.Another way the admixture of essences to attain must be tried, Ninmah was saying. How the two strands of essences to combine another way must be found,That which from the Earth is the portion must not be harmed.100
