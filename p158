In Shurubak, Ziusudra's city, the suffering unbearable was becoming.To Eridu Ziusudra, of the Earthlings a spokesman, journeyed,To the house of the lord Enki he made his way, by the name of his lord he called,For help and salvation to him he pleaded; Enki by Enlil's decrees was bound.In those days the Anunnaki for their own surviving were concerned;Their own rations were diminished, by Earth's changes they themselves afflicted became.On Earth as on Lahmu the seasons their regularity lost.For one Shar, for two Shars, from Nibiru the heavenly circuits were studied,Oddities in the planetary destinies from Nibiru were observed.On the Sun's face black spots were appearing, from its face flames shot up;Kishar also was misbehaving, its host its footings lost, dizzying were their circuits.The Hammered Bracelet was by unseen netforces pulled and pushed,For reasons unfathomed, the Sun its family was upsetting;The destinies of the celestials by unsavory fates were overtaken!On Nibiru the savants alarms raised, in the public squares the people gathered;The Creator of All, to primordial days the heavens is returning,Angry is the Creator of All! voices from amongst the people shouted.On Earth the tribulations were increasing, fear and famine their heads reared.For three Shars, for four Shars the instruments the Whiteland facing were observed,By Nergal and Ereshkigal odd rumblings in the Whiteland's snows were recorded:The snow-ice that the Whiteland covers to sliding has taken! So did they from Abzu's tip report. In the Land Beyond the Seas, Ninurta in his haven foretelling instruments established,Quakes and jitters at the Earth's bottom with the instruments he noticed.An odd matter is afoot! So did Enlil to Anu on Nibiru words of alarm send.158
