And the eyesight of Adapa having failed, for recognition his sons' faces he touched;And the face of Ka-in on the right was beardless, and the face of Sati on the left with beard was.And Adapa put his right hand on the head of Sati, the one on the left,And he blessed him and said: Of your seed shall the Earth be filled,And of your seed as a tree with three branches Mankind a Great Calamity shall survive.And he put his left hand on the head of Ka-in on his right, and to him said:For your sin of your birthright you are deprived, but of your seed seven nations shall come,In a realm set apart they shall thrive, distant lands they shall inhabit;But having your brother with a stone killed, by a stone will be your end.And when Adapa finished these words saying, his hands dropped and he sighed and said:Now summon my spouse Titi and all the sons and all the daughters,And after my spirit leaves me, to my birthplace by the river carry me,And with my face toward the rising Sun there bury me.Like a wounded beast Titi cried out, to her knees by Adapa's side she fell.And the two sons of Adapa, Ka-in and Sati, in a cloth his body wrapped,In a cave by the banks of the river, by Titi shown, Adapa they buried.In the midst of the ninety-third Shar was he born, by the end of the one hundred and eighth he died.A long life for an Earthling he had; the life cycle of Enki he did not have.And after Adapa was buried, Ka-in to his mother and brother farewell bade.Ninurta in his Bird of Heaven to the land of wandering him returned.And in a distant realm Ka-in had sons and daughters,And he for them a city built, and as he was building, by a falling stone he was killed. In the Edin Lu-Mach as a workmaster the Anunnaki served,In the days of Lu-Mach did Marduk and the Igigi with Earthlings intermarry.147
