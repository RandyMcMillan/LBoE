Let Weapons of terror be created! was the other suggestion; weapons that the ground shake loose, the mountains split asunder;With missiles the volcanoes to attack, their dormancy to bestir, their belching to increase, The atmosphere to replenish, the breach to make disappear!For a decision Lahma was too feeble; what choice to make he knewOne circuit Nibiru completed, two Shars Nibiru to count continued.In the fields, affliction was net diminished. By volcanic belching the atmosphere was not repaired.A third Shar passed, a forth was counted. Gold was not obtained.In the land strife was abundant; food and water were not abundant.In the land unity was gone; accusations were abundant.In the royal court, savants were coming and going; counselors were rushing in and rushing out.The king to their words paid no attention. Counsel from his spouse he only sought; Lahama was her name.If destiny it be, let us beseech the Great Creator of All, to the king she said. Beseeching, net actings, provide the only hope!In the royal court the princes were astir; at the king accusations were directed:Foolishly, unreasoning, greater calamities instead of cure he brought forth!From the olden storehouses, weapons were retrieved; of rebellion there was much speaking. A prince in the royal palace was the first to take up arms.By words of promise, the other princes he agitated; Alalu was his name.Let Lahrna be the king no more! he shouted. Let decision supplant hesitation!Come, let us unnerve the king in his dwelling; let him the throne abandon!The princes to his words gave heed; the gate of the palace they rushed;To the throne room, its entrance restricted, like onrushing waters they went.To the tower of the palace the king escaped; Alalu was him pursuing.22
