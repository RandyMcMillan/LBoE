My hands have made it! victoriously she shouted.Now this is the account of how Adamu by name was called,And how Ti-Amat as a counterpart female for him was fashioned.The newborn's visage and limbs the leaders carefully examined:Of good shape were his ears, his eyes were not clogged,His limbs were proper, hindparts like legs, foreparts like hands were shaped.Shaggy like the wild ones he was not, dark black his head hair was,Smooth was his skin, smooth as the Anunnaki skin it was,Like dark red blood was its color, like the clay of the Abzu was its hue.They looked at his malehood: Odd was its shape, by a skin was its forepart surrounded,Unlike that of Anunnaki malehood it was, a skin from its forepart was hanging!Let the Earthling from us Anunnaki by this foreskin be distinguished! So was Enki saying.The newborn to cry was beginning; to her chest Ninmah closely drew him;Her breast to him she gave; the breast he began to suckle.Perfection we did attain! Ningishzidda with elation was saying.Enki at his sister was gazing; a mother and son, not Ninmah and a Being, he was seeing.A name will you give him? Enki inquired. A Being he is, not a creature!Ninmah cast her hand upon the newborn's body, with her fingers his dark red skin she caressed.Adamu I shall call him! Ninmah was saying. One Who Like Earth's Clay Is, that will be his name! For the newborn Adamu a crib they fashioned, in a corner of the House of Life they placed him. A model for Primitive Workers we have indeed attained! Enki was saying.Now a host of Workers like him are needed! Ningishzidda his elders reminded.A model indeed he shall be; as for himself, like a Firstling he shall be treated, From toil he himself shall be protected, his essence alone as a mold shall be!105
