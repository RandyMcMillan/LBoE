When the avalanche of waters sweeps over the lands,Other living creatures, some by us from Nibiru originated, most from Earth itself evolved, In one sudden swoop to an extinction shall be doomed.Let us, you and me, their seed of life preserve, their life essences for safekeeping extract! Ninmah, she who gave life, to the words of Enki favor gave:I shall do it in Shurubak, you do so with the Abzu's living creatures! So to Enki she said. While the others sat idly waiting, Enki and Ninmah a challenging task undertook;Ninrnah in Shurubak by some of her female assistants was helped,Enki by Ningishzidda in the Abzu, at the olden House of Life, was assisted.Male and female essences and life-eggs they collected,Of each kind two by two, two by two they in Shurubak and the Abzu preserved,For safekeeping while in Earth circuit to be taken, thereafter the living kinds to recombine. At that time word from Ninurta came: Earth's rumblings ominous are!At that time word from Nergal and Ereshkigal came: The Whiteland is shaken!In Sippar all the Anunnaki gathered, the Day of the Deluge they awaited.Synopsis of the Tenth TabletThe mystery emissary appears to Enki in a dream-vision Enki is told to save Mankind through his son ZiusudraBy subterfuge Enki directs Ziusudra to build a submarineA navigator comes aboard, bringing Earth's seeds of life Nibiru's approach causes the Whiteland's icesheet to slip The resulting tidal wave engulfs the Earth with water The remaining Anunnaki bewail the calamity from Earth orbit The waters recede; Ziusudra's boat rests on Mount Salvation165
