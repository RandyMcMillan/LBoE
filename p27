From the crowds he stealthily escaped; of doing like Lahma he was fearful. Unbeknownst to others, to the place of the celestial chariots he hurriedly went. Into a missile-throwing chariot Alalu climbed; its hatch behind him he closed. The forepart chamber he entered; the commander's seat he occupied. That-Which-Shows-the-Way he lit up, with bluish aura the chamber filling.The Fire Stones he stirred up; their hum like music was enthralling.The chariot's Great Cracker he enlivened; a reddish brilliance it was casting.Unbeknownst to others, in the celestial boat Alalu from Nibiru escaped.To snow-hued Earth Alalu set his course; by a secret from the Beginning he chose his destination.Synopsis of the Second TabletAlalu's flight in a nuclear-armed spacecraftHe sets his course to Ki, the seventh planet (Earth) Why he expects to find gold on EarthThe solar-system's cosmogony; Taiamat's water and gold The appearance of Nibiru from outer spaceThe Celestial Battle and Tiamat's breakupEarth, half of Tiamat, inherits her waters and gold Kingu, Tiamat's main satellite, becomes the Moon of Earth Nibiru is destined to forever orbit the SunAlalu's arrival and landing on EarthAlalu, discovering gold, holds Nibiru's fate in his handsTHE SECOND TABLETTo snow-hued Earth Alalu set his course; but secret from the Beginning he chose his destination.27
