Now this is the secret command from Nibiru:The three of you on Earth will remain; only to die to Nibiru you will return!In celestial chariots, the Earth encircling, the calamity you shall outwait;To each of the other Anunnaki, a choice to leave or the calamity outwait must be given.The Igigi who Earthlings espoused must between departure and spouses choose:No Earthling, Marduk's Sarpanit included, to Nibiru to journey is allowed!For all who stay and what happens see, in celestial chariots they safety must seek!As for all the others, to depart for Nibiru forthwith they ready must be!So did Galzu Nibiru's commands to the leaders in secret reveal.Now this is the account of how the Anunnaki to abandon Earth decided,And how an oath they took Mankind to let in the Deluge perish.In Nibru-ki Enlil a council of Anunnaki and Igigi commanders summoned,The leaders' sons and their children also were present.Word of the impending calamity Enlil to them as a secret revealed.To a bitter end Earth Mission has come! to them he solemnly said.All who to leave wish in celestial boats that are ready to Nibiru will be evacuated,But if Earthling spouses they have, without the spouses they must leave.Igigi who to their spouses and offspring attached are, let them to the highest peaks on Earth escape!As for a few of us Anunnaki who will choose to stay, in Boats of Heaven in Earth's skies will we remain,The calamity to outwait, the fate of Earth to witness!As the commander, I shall be the first one to stay! So was Enlil saying.By their own choice will be the others!With my father I choose to stay, the calamity to face! So did Ninurta announce. To the Lands Beyond the Oceans after the Deluge I will return!161
