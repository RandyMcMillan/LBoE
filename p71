For the Seven Who judge, seven seats were provided; for Anu, presiding, the tallest seat was prepared.To his right Enki was seated; Enlil was seated on Anu's left.On Enki's right Anzu and Nungal were seated; Abgal and Alalgar to the left of Enlil sat.Before these Seven Who judge Alalu was brought; his hands and feet were untied.Enlil was first to speak: In fairness a wrestling match was held, Alalu the kingship to Anu forfeited!What say you, Alalu? Enki him this question asked.In fairness the wrestling match was held, the kingship I forfeited! Alalu said.Having been vanquished, Alalu an abominable crime performed, the malehood of Anu he bit and swallowed!Thus did Enlil the accusation of the crime make. Death is the punishment! Enlil was saying. What say you, Alalu? Enki his father-by-marriage asked.There was silence; Alalu the question did not answer.We all the crime did witness! Alalgar was saying, judgment must be in accordance!If words you wish to utter, speak before the judging! Enki to Alalu said.In the silence Alalu slowly began to speak:On Nibiru I was king, by right of succession I was reigning;Anu was my cupbearer. The princes he aroused, to a wrestling he me challenged;For nine counted circuits I was king on Nibiru, to my seed kingship was belonging.On my throne seat Anu himself sat, to escape death to distant Earth I made a dangerous journey.Salvation for Nibiru I, Alalu, on the alien planet discovered!Return to Nibiru I was promised, in fairness the throne to regain!Then to Earth came Ea; the one by compromise the next to reign Nibiru he was designated. Then came Enlil, the succession from Anu to himself claiming.Then Anu came, by lots he tricked Ea; Enki, the Lord of Earth, he was proclaimed,Of Earth, not of Nibiru, to be the master.71
