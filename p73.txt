By unanimity was this judgment upon Alalu imposed, in the presence of the heroes it was announced.Let Nungal be my pilot to Nibiru, therefrom chariots bearing heroes again to Earth to pilot. Let Anzu join for the journey, of the descent to Lahmu take charge!So did Anu commandments utter.On the morrow departing was readied; all who depart by boats to the chariot were ferried. A place for landings on firm soil you must prepare! Anu to Enlil was saving.How Lahmu as a way station to utilize, plans you should be making!Farewells there were, both joy and sorrow.Limping did Anu on the chariot embark, with his hands tied did Alalu the chariot enter.Then to the heavens the chariot soared up, and the royal visit had ended.They around the Moon made a circuit; Anu by the sight was enchanted.Toward red-hued Lahmu they journeyed, twice about it they circled.Lower toward the strange planet they came, mountains sky-high and tears in the surface they noticed.Where Ea's chariot had once landed they observed; by a lakeside it was located. Slowed by Lahmu netpower, in the chariot the sky chamber they readied.Anzu, its pilot, then unexpected words to Anu was saying:With Alalu to the firm soil of Lahmu I shall descend,With the sky chamber to the chariot to return I wish not!With Alalu on the strange planet I shall stay; until he dies I shall protect him. When he dies of his innards' poison, as befits a king him I shall bury!As for me, I shall have made my name;Anzu, they will say, against all odds to a king in exile a companion was,He saw things by others unseen, on a strange planet he faced unknown things! Anzu, they will to the end of times shall say, like a hero has fallen!73
