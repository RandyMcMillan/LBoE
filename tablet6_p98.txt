Enki to his brother responded: Not slaves, but helpers is my plan!The Being already exists! Ninmah was saying. To give more ability is the plan!Not a new creature, but one existing more in our image made! Enki with persuasion said, With little change it can be achieved, only a drop of our essence is needed!A grave matter it is, it is not to my liking! Enlil was saying.Against the rules of from planet to planet journeying it is,By the rules of to Earth coming it was forbidden.To obtain gold was our purpose, to replace the Father of All Beginning it was not!After Enlil thus had spoken, Ninmah was the one to respond:My brother! Ninmah to Enlil was saying,With wisdom and understanding has the Father of All Beginning us endowed,To what purpose have we so been perfected, else of it utmost use to make?With wisdom and understanding has the Creator of All our life essence filled,To whatever using of it we capable are, is it not that for which we have been destined? So was Ninmah words to her brother Enlil directing.With that which in our essence was granted, tools and chariots we have perfected, Mountains with terror weapons we shattered, skies with gold we are healing!So was Ninurta to his birth-giving mother saying.Let us with wisdom new tools fashion, not new beings create,Let by new equipments, not by slave beings, the toil be relieved!Whereto our understanding does us lead, to that we have been destined!So was Ningishzidda saying, with Enki and Ninmah he in agreement was.What knowledge we possess, its use cannot be prevented! Ningishzidda was saying. Destiny indeed cannot be altered, from the Beginning to the End it has been determined!98
