In the ninety-fifth Shar, a son Adapa and Titi finally had;Sati, He Who Life Binds Again, Titi him named; by him were the generations of Adapa counted. In all, thirty sons and thirty daughters Adapa and Titi had,Of them tillers of the land and shepherds for the Anunnaki to]led,By them did satiation to Anunnaki and Civilized Earthlings come back.In the ninety-seventh Shar, to Sati a son by his spouse Azura was born.By the name Enshi in the annals he was recorded; Master of Humanity meant his name.By Adapa his father writing and numbers he was made to understand,And who the Anunnaki were and all about Nibiru by Adapa Enshi was told.To Nibru-ki by the sons of Enlil he was taken; secrets of the Anunnaki him they taught.How the perfumed oils for anointing Nannar, Enlil's on Earth the eldest, him showed,How the elixir from the Inbu fruits to prepare Ishkur, Enlil's youngest, him instructed.It was since then that by Civilized Man the Anunnaki lords were called.And of the rites of worship of the Anunnaki that the beginning was.Thereafter to Enshi by his sister Noam a son was born;Kunin, He of the Kilns, his name had the meaning.For by Niburta in Bad-Tibira he was tutored, of furnace and kiln there he learned,How with bitumens fires to make, how to smelt and refine he was taught;In the smelting and refining of gold for Nibiru he and his offspring toiled.In the ninety-eighth Shar did this matter come about.Now this is the account of the generations of Adapa after Ka-in was exiled,And the heavenly journeys of Enkime and the death of Adapa.In the ninety-ninth Shar to Kunin a son was born,By Mualit, a half sister of Kunin, he was conceived.143
