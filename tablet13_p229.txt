On the throne of Urim his son Shulgi him succeeded; full of vile and eager for battles Shulgi was.In Nibru-ki himself high priest he anointed, in Unug-ki the joys of Inanna's vulva he sought; Warriors from the mountainlands, to Nannar not beholden, in his army he enlisted,With their help the western lands he overran, the sanctity of Mission Control Center he ignored. In the sacred Fourth Region his foot he set, King of the Four Regions himself he declared. About the defilements Enlil was angered, about the invadings Enki to Enlil spoke:The rulers of your region all bounds have exceeded! Enki to Enlil bitterly said. Of all the troubles Marduk is the fountainhead! Enlil to Enki retorted.Still the dream-vision to himself keeping, Enlil to Tirhu his attention turned. Upon lbru-Um, the eldest son of Tirhu, Enlil cast the choosing gaze.A princely offspring, valiant and with priestly secrets acquainted Ibruum was;To protect the sacred places, the chariots' ascents and descents enable, Enlil lbruum to go commanded.No sooner did lbruum from Harran depart than in that city Marduk arrived;The defilements he too had observed, as birth pangs of a New Order he them deemed. From Harran, on the threshold of Shumer, his final thrust he planned,From Harran, at the edge of Ishkur's domains situated, the raising of armies he directed. When twenty-and-four Earth years of his sojourn in Harran had passed,Marduk to the other gods, of whomever descended, tearfully an appeal made; Confessing his transgressions but insisting on his lordship, to them he thus said:Oh gods of Harran, oh great gods who judge, learn my secrets!As I girdle my belt, my memories I remember:I am the divine Marduk, a great god, in my domains as Ra am I known.For my sins to exile I went, to the mountains have I gone, in many lands I wandered, From where the sun rises to where the sun sets I went, to the land of Ishkur I came.229
