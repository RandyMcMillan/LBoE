They eat plants with their mouths, they drink water from lake and ditch. Shaggy with hair is their whole body, their head hair is like a lion's;With gazelles they jostle, with teeming creatures in the waters they delight! The leaders to Enki's words with amazement listened.No creature like that has ever in the Edin been seen! Enlil, disbelieving, said.Aeons ago, on Nibiru, our predecessors like that might have been! Ninmah was saying. It is a Being, not a creature!Ninmah was saying. To behold it must be a thrill!To the House of Life Enki led them; in strong cages there were some of the beings.At the sight of Enki and the others they jumped up, with fists on the cage bars they were beating.They were grunting and snorting; no words were they speaking.Male and female they are! Enki was saying; malehoods and femalehoods they have,Like us, from Nibiru coming, they are procreating.Ningishzidda, my son, their Fashioning Essence has tested;Akin to ours it is, like two serpents it is entwined;When their with our life essence shall be combined, our mark upon them shall be,A Primitive Worker shall be created! Our commands will he understand,Our tools he will handle, the toil in the excavations he shall perform;To the Anunnaki in the Abzu relief shall come!So was Enki with enthusiasm saying, with excitement his words came forth.Enlil at the words was hesitating: The matter is one of great importance!On our planet, slavery has long ago been abolished, tools are the slaves, not other beings! A new creature, beforehand nonexisting, you wish to bring into being;Creation in the hands of the Father of All Beginning alone is held!So was Enlil in opposing saying; stern were his words.97
