Before the Prior Times was the Beginning; after the Prior Times were the Olden Times.In the Olden Times the gods came to Earth and created the Earthlings.In the Prior Times, none of the gods was on the Earth, nor were the Earthlings yet fashioned.In the Prior Times, the abode of the gods was on their own planet; Nibiru is its name.A great planet, reddish in radiance; around the Sun an elongated circuit Nibiru makes.For a time in the cold is Nibiru engulfed; for part of its circuit by the Sun strongly is it heated.A thick atmosphere Nibiru envelops, by volcanic eruptions constantly fed.All manner of life this atmosphere sustains; without it there will be only perishing!In the cold period the inner heat of Nibiru it keeps about the planet, like a warm coat that is constantly renewed.In the hot period it shields Nibiru from the Sun's scorching rays.In its midst rains it holds and releases, to lakes and streams giving rise.Lush vegetation our atmosphere feeds and protects; all manner of life in the waters and on the land to sprout it caused.After aeons of time our own species sprouted, by our own essence an eternal seed to procreate.As our numbers grew, to many regions of Nibiru our ancestors spread.Some tilled the land, some four-legged creatures shepherded.Some lived on the mountains, some in the valleys their home made.Rivalries occurred, encroachments happened; clashes occurred, sticks became weapons. Clans gathered into tribes, then two great nations each other faced.The nation of the north against the nation of the south took up arms.What was held by hand to thrusting missiles was turned; weapons of thunder and brilliance increased the terror.A war, long and fierce, engulfed the planet; brother amassed against brother. There was death and destruction both north and south.For many circuits desolation reigned the land; all life was diminished.15
