Thereupon Ninmah against Enki a cursing tittered,Whatever food he ate was poison in his innards; his jaw hurt, his tooth hurt, his ribs were hurting.Isimud the Anunnaki summoned, to Ninmah for relief they were pleading.To distance himself from Ninmah's vulva Enki by raised arm swore;One by one she his ailments removed, from her curse Enki was freed.To the Edin Ninmah returned, never to be espoused; Anu's command was fulfilled! To Earth Enki his spouse Damkina with their son Marduk summoned;Ninki, Lady of Earth, the title she was granted.By her and by concubines Enki five more sons had, these were their names:Nergal and Gibil, Ninagal and Ningishzidda, and Dumuzi the youngest.To Earth Enlil and Ninmah their son Ninurta summoned,By his spouse Ninlil did Enlil one more son have, to Nannar a full brother; Ishkur was his name.Three sons in all did Enlil have, none by concubines were they born.Two clans were thus on Earth established; their rivalries to wars did lead.Now this is the account of the mutiny of the Igigi,And how Anzu to death was put, for stealing the Tablets of Destinies punished.From the Abzu gold from Earth's veins to the Landing Place was carried,Thence Igigi in rocketships to the way station on Lahmu transported.From the planet Lahmu in celestial chariots was the precious metal to Nibiru brought;On Nibiru was the gold to the finest dust fashioned, to protect the atmosphere it was employed. Slowly was the breach in the heavens healing, slowly was Nibiru saved!In the Edin the five cities were perfected.Enki in Eridu a sparkling abode made, upon soil skyward raised he built it,Like a mountain he raised it above the ground, in a good place he built it.87
