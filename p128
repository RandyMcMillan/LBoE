The second young one to him Enki called, berries from the field she him offered. Enki bent down, the young one he embraced, on her lips he kissed her;Sweet were her lips, firm with ripeness were her breasts.Into her womb he poured his semen, in a mating he knew her.Into her womb she took the holy semen, by the semen of the lord Enki she was impregnated. With the young ones stay, whether pregnancies come about ascertain!So was Enki to his vizier Isimud saying.Isimud by the young ones sat down; by the fourth count their bulges appeared.By the tenth count, the ninth having been completed,The first young one squatted and birth gave, by her a male child was born;The second young one squatted and birth gave, by her a female child was born.At dawn and dusk, which a day delimit, on the same day the two were born,The Gracious Ones, Dawn and Dusk, thereafter in legends they were known.In the ninety-third Shar the two, by Enki fathered, in the Edin were born.Word of the births Isimud to Enki quickly brought.By the births Enki was ecstatic: Whoever such a thing has ever known!Between Anunnaki and Earthling, conception was attained,Civilized Man I have brought into being!To his vizier Isimud Enki instructions gave: A secret must my deed remain!Let the newborns by their mothers be suckled; thereafter into my household them bring, Among the bulrushes in reed baskets have I them found! Thus to all you will say!By their mothers were the newborns suckled and nurtured;To Enki's household in Eridu thereafter Isimud them brought.Among the bulrushes, in reed baskets, have I them found! So did Isimud to all say.128
