How through the Hammered Bracelet to Nibiru can it be brought?Thus did Enlil, the son of Anu, speak; others many questions also asked.Much proof was greatly needed, many answers are required, all agreed.The words of the assembly to Alalu were conveyed, a response demanded.Alalu the words' merit pondered, to transmit his secrets he agreed;Of his journey and its perils in truth he an account gave.Of the Tester its crystal innards he removed, from the Sampler its crystal heart he took out;Into the Speaker he the crystals inserted, all the findings to transmit.Now that proof has been delivered, declare me king, bow to my command! he sternly demanded.The sages were aghast; with Weapons of Terror Alalu on Nibiru more havoc caused,With Weapons of Terror a path through the Bracelet he blasted!Once in its circuit Nibiru that region passes, calamities Alalu is amassing!In the council there was much consternation; the kingship to alter was indeed a grave matter. Anu not by ancestry alone was king: By fair wrestling the throne he attained!In the assembly of the princes, a son of Anu stood up to speak.He was wise in all matters, among the sages renowned he was.Of the secrets of waters he was a master; E.A, He Whose Home Is Water, he was called.Of Anu he was the Firstborn; to Damkina, Alalu's daughter, he was espoused.My father by birth is Anu the king, Ea was saying; Alalu by marriage my father is.To bring the two clans into unison was my espousal's intention;Let me be the one in this conflict unity to bring!Let me Anu's emissary to Alalu be, let me be the one Alalu's discoveries to uphold!Let me in a chariot to Earth journey, a path through the Bracelet with water, not fire, I shall fashion.On Earth, from the waters let me the precious gold obtain; to Nibiru back it will be sent.47
