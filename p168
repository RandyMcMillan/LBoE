On all the habitations, over the cities, a calamitous storm will sweep, The destruction of Mankind and its offspring it will be.This is the final ruling, the word of the assembly by Enlil convened, This is the decision by Anu and Enlil and Ninmah spoken.Now heed my words, observe the message that to you I am speaking:Abandon your house, build a boat; spurn possessions, save the life!The boat that you must build, its design and measurements on a tablet are shown,By the reed hut's wall the tablet I shall leave.Make sure that the boat shall be roofed throughout, the sun from the inside must not be seen. The tackle must be very strong, the pitch strong and tight to ward off the water.Let the boat be one that can turn and tumble, the watery avalanche to survive!In seven days build the boat, into it your family and kinfolk gather,In the boat food and water for drinking heap up, household animals also bring.Then, on the appointed day, a signal to you shall be given;A boatguide who knows the waters, by me appointed, to you that day will come;On that day the boat you must enter, its hatch tightly close you must.An overwhelming Deluge, coming from the south, lands and life shall devastate;Your boat from its moorings it shall lift, the boat it shall turn and tumble.Fear not: To a safe haven the boatguide will navigate you,By you shall the seed of Civilized Mankind survive!When Enki's voice fell silent, agog was Ziusudra, on his knees prostrate he fell:My lord! My lord! he shouted. Your voice I heard, let me see your face!Not to you, Ziusudra, have I spoken, to the reed wall did I speak! So Enki said.By Enlil's decision, by an oath upheld am I bound to that all the Anunnaki swore;168
