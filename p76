Of mountains and rivers he took account, of valleys and plains the measures he took. Where a Landing Place to establish, a place for the rocketships, he was seeking.Enlil, by the heat of the Sun afflicted, for a place of coolness and shade was searching. To snow-covered mountains on the Edin's north side he took a liking,The tallest trees he ever saw grew there in a cedar forest.There above a mountain valley with power beams the surface he flattened.Great stones from the hillside the heroes quarried and to size cut.To uphold the platform with skyships they carried and emplaced them.With satisfaction did Enlil the handiwork consider,A work beyond belief indeed it was, a structure of everlasting!An abode for himself, on the crest of the mountain, was his desire.Of the tall trees in the cedar forest long beams were prepared,Of them the construction of an abode for himself he decreed:The Abode of the North Crest he named it.On Nibiru, a new celestial chariot for soaring off was prepared,New kinds of rocketships, skyships, and that which Enki had designed it was transporting.A fresh group of fifty from Nibiru it was taking; chosen females among them were.By Ninmah, Exalted Lady, were they commanded; in succor and healing were they trained.Ninmah, Exalted Lady, a daughter of Anu she was; a half sister, not a full sister, of Enki and Enlil she was.In succor and healing she was greatly learned, in the treating of ailments she excelled.To the complaints from Earth she gave much attention, a healing was she preparing!The course of prior chariots, on Tablets of Destinies recorded, Nungal its pilot did follow.Unharmed it reached the celestial god Lahmu; it circled the planet, slowly to its surface it descended.A faint beaming a group of heroes followed; Ninmah was going with them.76
