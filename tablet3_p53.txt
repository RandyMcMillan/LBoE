At the edge of the marshes, a sight there was to behold:Gleaming in the sunrays was a chariot from Nibiru; Alalu's celestial boat it was!The heroes their paces quickened, toward Alalu's chariot they hurried.Impatient, Ea donned his Fish's suit; within his chest his heart was like a drum beating.Into the marsh he jumped, toward its edge hurried steps he directed.High were the marshes flooding, deeper was the bottom than he expected.He changed his gait to swimming, with bold strokes forward he advanced.As dry land he was approaching, green meadows he could see.Then his feet touched firm ground; he stood up and by walking he continued.Ahead he could see Alalu standing, with his hands with vigor waving.Coming out of the waters, ashore Ea stepped: On dark-hued Earth he was standing!Alalu toward him came running; his son by marriage he powerfully embraced.Welcome to a different planet! Alalu to Ea said.Now this is the account of how Eridu on Earth was established, how the count of seven days was begun.In silence did Alalu Ea embrace, with tears of joy his eyes were filled.Before him Ea bowed his head, respect for his father by marriage he was showing.In the marshes the heroes were advancing; more donned Fishes' suits, more toward the dry land were rushing.Keep the chariot afloat! Anzu was commanding. In the waters anchor it, the mud ahead avoiding!Ashore stepped the heroes, before Alalu they were bowing. Ashore came Anzu, the last the chariot to depart.Before Alalu he bowed; with him Alalu in welcome locked arms. To all who had arrived Alalu words of welcome spoke.To all who were assembled, Ea words of command spoke. Here on Earth I am the commander! he was saying.53
