Beside a lakeshore Anzu they found; from his helmet the signals were beaming.Anzu himself was without motion, prostrate, he lay dead.Ninmah touched his face, to his heart she gave attention.From her pouch she took out the Pulser; upon Anzu's heart pulsing she directed.From her pouch she took out the Emitter, its crystals' life-giving emissions on his body she directed.Sixty times did Ninmah direct the Pulser, sixty times the Emitter she directed; On the sixtieth time Anzu his eyes opened, with his lips he motioned.Gently upon his face Ninmah Water of Life poured, his lips with it wetting. Gentle into his mouth the Food of Life she placed;Then the miracle did happen: Anzu from the dead arose!About Alalu they him then inquired; of Alalu's death Anzu them told.He led them to a great rock, from the plain heavenward protruding.There to them what had happened he was telling:Alalu soon after the landing from unremitting pain to scream began.From his mouth his innards he was spitting; in agony he peered over the wall!Thus was Anzu to them saying.He led them to a great rock, like a mountain from the plain heavenward rising.In the great rock a cave I found, Alalu's corpse therein l hid,Its entrance with stones I covered. So was Anzu to them saying.They followed him to the rock, the stones they removed, the cave they entered.Inside what of Alalu remained they found;He who once on Nibiru a king was a pile of bones was in a cave now lying!For the First time in our annals, a king not on Nibiru has died, not on Nibiru was he buried! So did Ninmah say. Let him in peace for eternity rest! she was saying.77
