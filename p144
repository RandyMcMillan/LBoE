Malalu, He Who Plays, she named him; in music and song he excelled.For him Ninurta a stringed harp made, a flute for him he shaped;Hymns to Ninurta Malalu played, with his daughters before Ninurta they sang.The spouse of Malalu the daughter of his father's brother was, Dunna was her name.In the one hundredth Shar since the count on Earth had begun,A son to Malalu and Dunna was born, their firstborn he was;Irid, He of the Sweet Waters, his mother Dunna him named.Him Dumuzi how wells to dig had taught, for flocks in distant meadows water to provide. It was there, by the wells in the meadows, that shepherds and maidens gathered, Where espousing and proliferation by Civilized Mankind exceedingly abounded.In his days the Igigi to Earth were more frequently coming.To observe and see from the heavens they increasingly abandoned,To watch and see what on Earth was transpiring they increasingly desired;To be with them on Lahmu Enki Marduk beseeched,To watch and see what on Earth was transpiring Marduk more fervently wished.At a well in the meadows did Irid his spouse meet;Baraka was her name, the daughter of his mother's brother she was.At the conclusion of the hundred and second Shar a son to them was born,By, the name Enki-Me, by Enki ME Understanding, in the annals he was called.Wise and intelligent he was, numbers he quickly understood,About the heavens and all matters celestial he was constantly curious.To him the lord Enki took a liking, secrets once to Adapa revealed to him he told.Of the family of the Sun and the twelve celestial gods Enki him was teaching,And how the months by the Moon were counted and the years by the Sun,144
