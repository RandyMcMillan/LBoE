Thus were the metals that were in the waters in the vessel collected.Ingenious was Ea's handiwork, an Artful Fashioner indeed he was!For six Earth days marsh waters were sucked in, marsh waters were spat out;In the vessel metals indeed were collected!The metals on the seventh day by Ea and Alalu were examined; of many kinds were the metals in the vessel.Iron there was, much copper there was; of gold there was no abundance.In the chariot another vessel, the artful handiwork of Nudimmud,The Metals after their kinds were separated, ashore kind by kind they were carried.For six days thus did the heroes toil; on the seventh day they rested.For six days were the crystal vessels filled and emptied,On the seventh day were the metals accounted.There was iron and there was copper, and other metals too;Of the gold, the smallest pile was accumulated.In the nighttimes the Moon waxed and waned; by the name Month did Ea its circuit call.At Month's very start, its luminous horns six days signified,By its half crown the seventh day it announced; a day to rest it was.At midway by a fullness was the Moon distinguished; then it paused to become diminished.With the Sun's course was the Moon's circuit appearing, with Earth's circuit it was its face revealing.Fascinated by the Moon's motions was Ea, its attachment as Kingu to Ki he contemplated: What purpose did the attachment serve, what heavenly sign was it giving:A Month did Ea the Moon's circuit call, Month to its circuit he gave the name.For one Month, for two Months, in the chariot were the waters separated;The Sun, every six Months, to Earth another season gave; Winter and Summer did Ea by names them call.58
