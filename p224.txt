The foremost from the earliest times! So he decreed in the hymns to be called; Lord of eternity, he who everlastingness has made, over all the gods presiding, The one who is without equal, the great solitary and sole one!So did Marduk, as Ra, above all other gods himself emplace,Their powers and attributes to himself he by himself assigned;As Enlil I am for lordship and decrees, as Ninurta for the hoe and combat;As Adad for lightning and thunder, as Nannar for illuminating the night;As Utu I am Shamash, as Nergal over the Lower World I reign;As Gibil the golden depths I know, whence copper and silver come I have found;As Ningishzidda numbers and their count I command, the heavens my glory bespeak!By these proclamations the Anunnaki leaders were greatly alarmed,To their father Enki the brothers of Marduk spoke, Nergal to Ninurta their concerns conveyed. What has you overpowered? Enki to his son Marduk said. Unheard of are your pretensions! The heavens, the heavens my supremacy bespeak! Marduk his father Enki answered.The Bull of Heaven, Enlil's constellation sign, by his own offspring was slain,In the heavens the Age of the Ram, my age, is coming, unmistakable the omens are!In his abode, in Eridu, the circle of the twelve constellations Enki examined,On the first day of spring, the beginning of a year, sunrise was carefully observed;In the constellation stars of the Bull was the sun that day rising.In Nibru-ki and Urim Enlil and Nannar the observations made,In the Lower World, where the Instruments Station had been, Nergal the results attested: Still remote was the time of the Ram, the Age of the Bull of Enlil it still was!In his domains, Marduk in his assertions did not relent. By Nabu he was assisted,To domains not his emissaries he sent, to the people that his time has come to announce.224
