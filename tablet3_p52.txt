They circled the Moon; by the vanquishing Nibiru in the Celestial Battle it prostrate and scarred was lying.Having the Chariot thus slowed clown, toward the seventh planet Anzu the chariot directed.Once, twice the Earth's globe he made the chariot circle, ever closer to the Firm Land he lowered it.Snow hued was two thirds of the planet, dark hued was its middle.They could see the oceans, they could see the Firm Lands; for the signal beacon from Alalu they were searching.Where an ocean touched dry land, where four rivers were swallowed by marshes, Alalu's signal was beaconed.Too heavy and large the chariot is for the marshes! Anzu was declaringThe Earth's pulling net, too powerful for on dry land to descend it is! Anzu to Ea announced.Splash down! Splash down in the ocean's waters! Ea to Anzu shouted.Around the planet Anzu made one more circuit, the chariot with much care toward the ocean's edge he lowered.The chariot's lungs he filled with air; into the waters down it splashed, into the depth, it was not sinking.From the Speaker a voice was heard: To Earth be welcomed! Alalu was saying.By his beamed words the direction of his whereabouts was determined.Toward the place Anzu the chariot directed, floating as a boat it was upon the waters moving.Soon the wide-ranging ocean narrowed, dry land on both sides as guardian appeared.On the left side brown-hued hills were rising, on the right mountains to heaven their heads raised.Toward the place of Alalu was the chariot moving, floating like a boat upon the waters it was. Ahead the dry land was covered with flooding, marshes the ocean were replacing.Anzu to heroes commands uttered, their Fishes' suits to put on he ordered.A hatch of the chariot was then opened, into the marshes the heroes descended.Strong ropes to the chariot they attached, with the ropes the chariot they were pulling. Alalu's beamed words more powerful were becoming. Hurry! Hurry! he was saying.52
