Sud becomes Enlil's Spouse Ninlil, bears a son (Nannar) Ninmah Joins Enki in the Abzu, bears him daughters Ninki, Enki's spouse, arrives with their son Marduk Clans form on Earth as Enki and Enlil beget more sons Beset by hardships, the Igigi launch a coup against Enlil Ninurta defeats their leader Anzu in aerial battles The Anunnaki, driven to produce gold faster, mutiny Enlil and Ninurta denounce the mutineersEnki suggests to artificially fashion Primitive WorkersTHE FIFTH TABLETFrom the planet Lahmu the chariot departed, toward Earth the journey it continued. Around the Moon they made circuits, a way station thereon to explore.Around the Earth they made circuits, toward a splashdown slowing.In the waters beside Eridu did Nungal the chariot bring down.To a quay, by Enlil constructed, they stepped off; boats were no longer needed.Enlil and Enki their sister with embraces greeted, with Nungal the pilot they locked arms. The heroes, male and female, by the present heroes were with shouts greeted.All that the chariot had brought was quickly unloaded:Rocketships and skyships, and the tools by Enki designed, and provisions of all kinds.Of all that on Nibiru transpired, of the death and burying of Alalu, Ninmah her brothers told; Of the way station on Lahmu and the commanding by Anzu she to them related.Enki of that uttered approval, Enlil words of bewilderment uttered.That is Anuâ€™s decision, his word is unalterable! Ninmah to Enlil was saying.79
