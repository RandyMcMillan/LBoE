Where for heroes dwellings to prepare, where the bowels of the Earth to enter.In his skyship the extent of the Abzu he measured, its districts he did carefully survey.A distant land the Abzu was, beyond the waters from the Edin it was away;A rich land it was, bursting with riches, perfect in fullness.Mighty rivers rushed across the region, great waters there rapidly flowed;An abode by the flowing waters Enki for himself established,To the midst of the Abzu, to a place of pure waters Enki betook himself.In that land the Place of Deepness Enki determined, for the heroes into Earth's bowels to descend.The Earth Sputter Enki there established, therewith in the Earth a gash to make, By way of tunnels Earth's innards to reach, the golden veins to uncover.Nearby That-Which-Crunches and That-Which-Crushes he emplaced,The gold-bearing ores to crunch and crush, by skyships to be carried,To the Landing Place in the cedar mountains to be brought,Therefrom by rocketships to the way station on Lahmu to be transported.On Earth more heroes were arriving, some to the Edin were assigned, some in the Abzu tasks were given.Laarsa and Lagash by Enlil were constructed, Shurubak for Ninmah he did establish.With her therein a host of female healers were dwelling, young ones who give succor.In Nibru-ki Enlil a Bond Heaven-Earth was assembling, from there all missions to command.Between Eridu and the Abzu Enki was journeying, back and forth for supervising he went.On Lahmu construction was progressing; heroes for the Way Station were also arriving.A Shar, two Shars were the preparations lasting; then Anu gave the word.On Earth the seventh day it was, a day of resting by Enki at the beginning decreed.At every place the heroes were assembled, a message from Anu from Nibiru beamed they overheard;In the Edin they were assembled, Enlil was there in command.82
