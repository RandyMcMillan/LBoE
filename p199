To obliteration destroy it. to his lieutenants Ninurta shouted.Retracing his steps, through the grand gallery to the topmost chamber Ninurta went,In a hollowed-out chest the heart of the Ekur pulsated, its netforce by five compartments was enhanced.With his baton Ninurta the stone chest struck; with a resonating sound it responded.Its Gug Stone, that directions determined, Ninurta ordered to be taken out, to a place of his choice carried.Coming down the grand gallery, Ninurta the twenty-seven pairs of Nibiru crystals examined.

Ninurta, victorious, declared.On the battleground the assembled Anunnaki the praise of Ninurta announced:Like Anu you are made! to their hero and leader they shouted.To replace the incapacitated beacon a mount near the Place of the Celestial Chariots was chosen,Within its innards the salvaged crystals were rearranged.Upon its peak the Gug Stone, the Stone of Directing, was installed;Mount Mashu, Mount of the Supreme Celestial Barque, the mount was called.At that time Enlil his three sons summoned; Ninlil and Ninharsag also attended.
