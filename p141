To Eridu city Adapa returned, what had happened to the lord Enki he told.With fury Enki Ka-in confronted. Accursed you shall be! to him he said.From the Edin you must depart, among Anunnaki and Civilized Earthlings you shall not stayAs to Abael, in the fields his body cannot for the wild birds remain;As the Anunnaki custom is, he in a grave, below a stone pile, shall be buried.How Abael to bury Enki to Adapa and Titi showed, for the custom to them was not known.For thirty days and thirty nights was Abael by his parents mourned.To Eridu for judgment Ka-in was brought, the exile sentence to pronounce Enki wished.For his deed, Ka-in himself must be slain! So did Marduk with anger say.Let the Seven Who judge be assembled! So did Ninurta, of Ka-in the mentor, say.Whoever of such an assembling ever heard!

My son! to Marduk Enki softly spoke. Your agony is great. Let us not agony with agony compound!A secret that on my heart has heavily emburdened let me to you tell!Once upon a time, as by the river I strolled, two Earthling maidens my fancy caught, By them from my seed were Adapa and Titi conceived,A new kind of Earthling, a Civilized Man, by that upon the Earth was brought;141
