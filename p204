To the one who grows bright, the heavenly planet of the lord Anu, they sang.On the signal a bonfire was lit, seen from place to place were the bonfires started:Before the night was over, the whole land of Edin was with bonfires lit!After a meal of bull meat and ram meat, of fish and fowl, with wine and beer accompanied,Anu and Antu to their overnight quarters were accompanied; by Anu and Antu were all the Anunnaki thanked.For several Earth days and nights Anu and Antu slept; on the sixth day his two sons and daughter Anu summoned.Of what had on Earth transpired their accounts he heard, of the peace and the warfare he learned.Of how the Earthlings, by the oath of Enlil to be wiped off, had again proliferated Anu heard;Of the gold discovery in the land beyond the oceans and the chariot's place there, Enlil to him revealed.It was then that of the dream and the tablet from Galzu Enki to his father told. By that was Anu greatly puzzled: A secret emissary by that nameTo Earth by me was never sent! So did Anu to the three leaders say.Puzzled were Enki and Enlil, baffled they at each other looked.On account of Galzu Ziusudra and the seed of life were saved! Enki said.On account of Galzu on Earth we remained! Enlil to his father said.The day to Nibiru you return you shall die, so did Galzu to us say.Incredulous of that was Anu; the change of cycles indeed havoc did cause, but with elixirs cured it was!Whose emissary, if not yours, was Galzu? Enki and Enlil in unison said.Who the Earthlings to save wanted, who on Earth made us stay?Ninharsag her head slowly nodded: For the Creator of All did Galzu appear!Was the creation of the Earthlings also destined, of that I must wonder!For a while the four of them were silent; each one past events in his heart recounted. While fates we decreed, the hand of destiny every step directed! So did Anu say..204
