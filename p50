By her sight Anzu was attracted. Let us examine her waters! Anzu was saying.Ea to continue without stopping gave the word; it is a planet of no return, he forcefully said.Toward the heavenly An, the third in planetary counts, the chariot continued.On his side was An lying, his host of moons about him were whirling.The Tester's beams the presence of water was revealing; a stop if needed to Ea it was indicating.To continue the journey was Ea saying, toward Anshar, the heaven's foremost prince, he was directing.Soon the ensnaring pull of Anshar they could tell, his colored rings with fear they admired. Deftly did Anzu the chariot guide, the crushing dangers he cleverly avoided.The giant Kishar, foremost of firm planets, was next to be encountered.Her net's pull was overpowering; with great skill did Anzu the chariot's course divert.With fury Kishar at the chariot divine lightnings was thrusting, her host at the uninvited she directed.Slowly Kishar moved away, for the chariot the next enemy to encounter:Beyond the fifth planet the Hammered Bracelet was lurking!Ea his handiwork to set a-whirring commanded, the Water Thruster to prepare.Toward the host of turning boulders the chariot was rushing,Each one like a slingshot's stone ferociously at the chariot aimed.The word by Ea was given, with the force of a thousand heroes the stream of water was thrust.One by one the boulders turned face; a path for the chariot they were making! But as one boulder fled, another in its stead was attacking;A multitude beyond count was their number, a host for the splitting of Tiamat revenge seeking!Again and again Ea the commands gave, the Water Thruster to keep a-whirring; Again and again toward the host of boulders streams of water were directed; Again and again the boulders their faces turned, a path for the chariot making.50
