And all that on the dry lands was living in the avalanche of waters perished. Then, as in the Beginning, the waters to their basins were gathered,Waving back and forth, day by day the water level came lower.Then, forty days after the Deluge over the Earth swept, the rains also stopped. After the forty days Ziusudra the boat's hatch opened, his whereabouts to survey. A bright day it was, a gentle breeze was blowing;All alone, with no other sign of life, the boat upon a vast sea was lolling. Mankind, all living things, off the Earth's face are wiped out,No one except us few survived, but there is no dry land to set a foot upon!

He sent forth a dove; with a twig from a tree to the boat it returned!Now Ziusudra knew that the dry land from under the waters had emerged.
