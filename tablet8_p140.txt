It is I who the plains luxuriates, who furrows with grains makes heavy,In whose fields birds multiply, in whose canals fish become abundant,Sustaining bread by me is produced, with fish and fowl the Anunnaki's diet I variate!On and on the twin brothers each other disputed, through the wintertime they argued.When summer began it was not raining, the meadows were dry, the pastures dwindled.Into the fields of his brother Abael his flocks drove, from the Furrows and the canals to drink water.By this Ka-in was angered; to move the flocks away his brother he commanded. Farmer and shepherd, brother and brother, words of accusation uttered.They spat on each other, with their fists they fought.Creatly enraged, Ka-in a stone picked up, with it he Abael in the head struck. Again and again he hit him until Abael fell, his blood from him gushing.When Ka-in his brother's blood saw, Abael, Abael, my brother! he shouted.Motionless on the ground did Abael remain, from him his soul had departed.By the brother whom he had killed Ka-in remained, for a long time he sat crying.Titi it was who of the killing was the first to know by a premonition:In a dream-vision as she was sleeping Abael's blood she saw, in the hand of Ka-in it was. Adapa from his sleep she awakened, her dream-vision to him she told.A heavy sorrow fills my heart, did something terrifying happen?So did Titi to Adapa say; greatly agitated she was.In the morning the two from Eridu departed, to the whereabouts of Ka-in and Abael they went. In the field they found Ka-in, by the dead Abael he was still seated.A great cry of agony Titi shouted, Adapa spread mud on his head.What have you done? What have you done? to Ka-in they shouted.Silence was Ka-in's answer; to the ground he threw himself and wept.140
