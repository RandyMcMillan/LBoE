For King and Council Galzu speaks, his words are my command! So did the message from Anu state.That Enki and Ninmah be also summoned was Galzu's request.When they came, to Ninmah Galzu pleasantly smiled. Of the same school and age we are! to her he said.This Ninmah could not recall; the emissary was as young as a son, she was as his olden mother!Simple is the explanation! Galzu to her said: By our winter's slumbered life cycles it is caused! Indeed, this matter is of my mission a part; about the evacuation it is a secret.Ever since Dumuzi on Nibiru had stayed, returning Anunnaki on Nibiru examined were;Those who on Earth the longest stayed by the returning harshly were afflicted:Their bodies to Nibiru's cycles were accustomed no longer,Their sleep was disturbed, their eyesight was failing, the netforce of Nibiru weighted their walk.Their minds were also affected, as sons were older than the parents they had left!Death, my comrades, to the returnees quickly came; of that I am here a warning to give!The three leaders, on Earth the longest, by the words silent became.Ninmah was the first to speak: That much was to be expected! she was saying.Enki, the wise one, to her words consented: That much was clear! he said.Enlil with anger was seized: Before, the Earthlings like us were becoming,Now we as Earthlings have become to this planet imprisoned!This whole mission to a nightmare turned, by Enki and his Earthlings from masters, slaves we were made!To the outburst Galzu with compassion listened. Indeed much there is to ponder, he said,On Nibiru much thinking and soul-searching deep questions were raising:Should Nibiru to its fate been left, whatever by the Creator of All intended, to be let to happen, Or was the coming to Earth by the Creator of All conceived, and we only unwitting emissaries? Of that, my comrades, the debate will continue! So was Galzu to them saying.160
