To them Enlil was thus saying. Destiny it is, or Fate it is,That to this planet us has brought, to gold from the waters foil,To put Anunnaki heroes to excavating toil, to a Primitive Worker create to be planning?That, my kinfolk, is the question! Thus, with graveness, Enlil was saying.Is it Destiny, is it Fate; That is what deciding requires,Is it from the Beginning ordained, or by us for choosing?To put the matter before Anu they decided; Anu before the council the matter presented.The elders, the savants, the commanders were consulted.Long and bitter the discussions were, of Life and Death, Fate and Destiny words were spoken. Can there be another way the gold to obtain? Survival is in danger!If gold must be obtained, let the Being be fashioned! the council decided.Let Anu forsake the rules of planetary journeys, let Nibiru be saved!From Anu's palace the decision to Earth was beamed; it Enki delighted.Let Ninmah my helper be, of such matters understanding she has!Thus was Enki saying. At Ninmah with a longing he was gazing.Let it so be! Ninmah was saving. Let it so be! Enlil did say.By Ennugi was the decision to the Anunnaki in the Abzu announced:Until the Being is achieved, to the toil willingly you must return! he said.There was disappointment; rebellion there was not; to the toil the Anunnaki returned.In the House of Life, in the Abzu, how to fashion the Being Enki to Ninmah was explaining.To a place among the trees Ninmah he directed, a place of cages it was.In the cages there were odd creatures, their likes in the wild no one had seen:Foreparts of one kind they had, hindparts of another creature they possessed;Creatures of two kinds by their essences combined to Ninmah Enki was showing!99
