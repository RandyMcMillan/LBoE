They chased away his ewes, his lambs and kids they drove away,The headdress of lordship they took off his head, the royal robe off his body they tore,The staff of shepherding they took and broke, his cup from its peg they threw down.Naked and barefooted they seized him, in fetters they his hands bound,In the name of the Princely Bird and the Falcon they left him dying.Disturbed and startled Dumuzi in the middle of the night awoke, to Geshtinanna the dream he told.The dream is not favorable!
