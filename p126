Let the mutiny once in the Abzu occurring not in the Edin be repeated!So to Enlil Ninurta said. With the Earthlings in the Edin, the heroes are becalmed,A few more Shars, and it will no longer matter! So did Ninurta to Enlil say.Enlil was not appeased; with grumbling, Let it so be! to his son he said.Let the gold pile up quickly, let us all to Nibiru soon return!In the Edin, the Anunnaki the Earthlings with admiration observed:Intelligence they possessed, of commands they had understanding.They took over all manner of chores; unclothed they were the tasks performing.Males with females among them were constantly mating, quick were their proliferations: In one Shar, sometimes four, sometimes more, were their generations!As the Earthlings grew in numbers, workers the Anunnaki had,With food the Anunnaki were not satiated;In the cities and in the orchard, in the valleys and in the hills,The Earthlings for food were constantly foraging.In those days grains had not yet been brought forth,There was no ewe, a lamb had not yet been fashioned.About these matters, Enlil to Enki angry words was saying:By your doings confusion was created, by you let salvation be devised!Now this is the account of how Civilized Man was brought about,How by a secret of Enki Adapa and Titi in the Edin were brought forth.By the proliferation of the Earthlings, Enki was pleased, Enki was worried;The lot of the Anunnaki was greatly eased, their discontent was diminished,By the proliferation the Anunnaki shunned toil, the workers as serfs were becoming.For seven Shars the Anunnaki's lot was greatly eased, diminished was their discontent.126
