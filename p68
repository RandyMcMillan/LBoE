Eridu have I established; let other settlements in this region be set up,Let it the Edin be, Abode of the Upright Ones, by this name be known.The commander of the Edin let me be, let Enlil the gold extraction perform!By these words Enlil was angered; the plan is wrongful! to Anu he said.Of commanding and tasks to perform I am the better, of sky ships I have the knowledge.Of the Earth and its secrets my half brother Ea is the knower;The Abzu he discovered, let him of the Abzu be the master!Anu to the angry words with a careful ear listened; the brothers were again half brothers,The Firstborn with the Legal Heir with words as weapons were contending!Ea was the Firstborn son, by a concubine to Anu he was born;Enlil, thereafter born, by Antu, Anu's spouse, was conceived.A half sister of Anu she was, thereby Enlil the Legal Heir making,Thereby the next-born son for the succession the Firstborn overcoming.A conflict that the obtainment of gold would endanger Anu was fearing;One of the brothers to Nibiru must return, the succession from considering must now be removed,So was Anu to himself thinking. Aloud to the two a startling suggestion he made:Who to Nibiru for the throne seat shall return, who the Edin shall command, who in the Abzu shall be the master,Let us three, I with you, by lots determine!Silent were the brothers, the audacious words by surprise them overtook.Let us draw lots! Anu said. By the hand of fate let there be a decision!The three, father and two sons, clasped their hands together.Thev cast lots, by the lots the tasks they divided:Anu to Nibiru to return, its ruler on the throne to remain;The Edin to Enlil was allotted, to be Lord of the Command as his name indicated,68
