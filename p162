Nannar, Enlil's on Earth firstborn, an odd wish announced:The Deluge to outwait not in Earth's skies but on the Moon; that was his wish.Enki an eyebrow raised; Enlil, though puzzled, approved.Ishkur, Enlil's youngest, to remain on Earth with his father his decision made.Utu and Inanna, Nannar's children who on Earth were born, to stay declared.Enki and Ninki, to stay and Earth not abandon chose; proudly they so announced.The Igigi and Sarpanit I shall not desert! Marduk with anger stated.One by one Enki's other sons their choice to stay announced: Nergal and Gibil, Ninagal and Ningishzidda and Dumuzi too.All eyes to Ninmah then turned; with pride her choice to stay she declared: My lifework is here! The Earthlings, my created, I shall not abandon!By her words Anunnaki and Igigi to a clamor were stirred; about the Earthlings' fate they inquired.Let the Earthlings for the abominations perish; so did Enlil proclaim.A wonderous Being by us was created, by us saved it must be, Enki to Enlil shouted.To this Enlil with his own shouted words retorted:From the very beginning, at every turn, the decisions by you modified were!To Primitive Workers procreating you gave, to them Knowing you endowed!The powers of the Creator of All into your hands you have taken,Thereafter even that by abominations you fouled.With fornication Adapa you conceived, Understanding to his line you gave!His offspring to the heavens you have taken, our Wisdom with them you shared!Every rule you have broken, decisions and command you ignored,Because of you by a Civilized Earthling brother a brother murdered,Because of Marduk your son the Igigi like him with Earthlings intermarried.Who is lordly from Nibiru, to whom the Earth alone belongs, to no one is no longer known!162
