Beyond in Nibiru's circuit were Anshar and Kishar, in their size the largest.As a messenger Gaga among the others coursed, sometimes first Nibiru to meet.Five in all were Nibiru's heavenly greeters as the Sun it circled.Beyond, like a boundary, the Hammered Bracelet the Sun encircled;As a guardian of the heaven's forbidden region with havoc it protected.Other children of the Sun, four in number, from intrusion the bracelet shielded.The atmospheres of the five greeters Enshar set out to study.In its repeating circuit, the five in Nibiru's loop carefully were examined.What atmospheres they possessed by observation and with celestial chariots intensely were examined.The findings were astounding, the discoveries confusing.From circuit to circuit Nibiru's atmosphere more breaching suffered.In the councils of the learned, cures were avidly debated; ways to bandage the wound were urgently considered.A new shield to embrace the planet was attempted; all that was thrust up back to the ground came down.In the councils of the learned, the belching volcanoes were studied.The atmosphere by belching volcanoes having been created, its wound by their diminished belching had come to be.Let with invention new belching be encouraged, let volcanoes spew again! one savants group was saying.How the feat to achieve, with what tools more belching to attain, none the king could inform. In the reign of Enshar the breach in the skies grew bigger.Rains were withheld, winds blew harder; springs from the depths did not arise.In the lands there was an accusation; the breasts of mothers were dry.In the palace there was distress; an accursation therein took hold.As his First Wife, Enshar a half sister did espouse, by the Law of the Seed abiding.20
