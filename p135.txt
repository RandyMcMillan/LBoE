Let there a celebration be, let us our guests thus welcome! Anu was saying.To the banquet room Anu all who were assembled led, to the laden tables he happily gestured.At the laden table bread of Nibiru Adapa was offered; he did not eat it.At the laded tables elixir of Nibiru Adapa was offered; he did not drinnk it.By this Anu the king was puzzled, was offended:Why has Enki to Nibiru this ill-mannered Earthling sent, to him the celestial ways reveal?Come now, Adapa! to Adapa Anu said. Why did you neither eat nor drink, our hospitality rejected?My master the lord Enki commanded me: The bread do not eat, the elixir do not drink! So did Adapa the king Anu answer.How odd is this thing! Anu was saying. For what has Enki from an Earthling our food and elixir prevented?He asked Ilabrat, he asked Dumuzi; Ilabrat the answer knew not, Dumuzi could not explain. He asked Ningishzidda. Perchance in this lies the answer! Ningishzidda to Anu said.The secret tablet that he carried hidden to Anu the king he then gavePuzzled was Anu, Anu was concerned; to his private chamber he went the tablet to decipher. Now this is the account of Adapa, of Civilized Mankind the progenitor,And how by his Sons Ka-in and Abael satiation on Earth was started.In his private chamber Anu the tablet's seal broke open,Into the scanner the tablet he inserted, it,, message from Enki to decipher.Adapa by my seed to an Earthling woman was born! So did the message from Enki say. Likewise was Titi by another Earthling woman of my seed conceived.With wisdom and speech they are endowed; with Nibiru's long lifetime they are not. The bread of long-living he should not eat, the elixir of long life he should not drink.To live and die on Earth Adapa must return, mortality his lot must be,By the sowing and shepherding by his offspring on Earth satiation shall be!135
