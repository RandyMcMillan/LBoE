Seven Who Judge on Enlil a punishment decreed:Let Enlil from all cities be banished, to a Land of No Return let him exiled be!In a sky chamber they made Enlil leave the Landing Place; Abgal was its pilot.To a Land of No Return Enlil was taken, never to return!In the sky chamber the two of them journeyed, to another land was their direction.There, amidst forbidding mountains, at a place of desolation, Abgal the sky chamber landed.This your place of exile shall be! Abgal to Enlil was saying.Not perchance have I it chosen! to Enlil he was saying. A secret of Enki in it is hidden,In the nearby cave Enki seven Weapons of Terror has hidden,From Alalu's celestial chariot he had them removed.Take the weapons into your possession, with the weapons your freedom attain!So was Abgal to his commander saying; a secret of Enki to Enlil he did reveal!Then from the secret place Abgal departed; Enlil alone was there left.In the Edin Sud to Ninmah, her commander, words was speaking:By Enlil's seed am I pregnant, a child of Enlil in my womb has been conceived!Ninmah Sud's words to Enki conveyed; the Lord of Earth he was, on Earth he was supreme!They summoned Sud before Seven Who judge: Will you take Enlil as your spouse? they her asked.Words of consent she uttered; the words by Abgal to Enlil in his exile were conveyed.To espouse Sud Enlil from his exile was returned; by that did Enki and Ninmah to him a pardon give.Enlil's official spouse Sud was declared; on her the name-title Ninlil, Lady of the Command, was bestowed.Thereafter to Ninlil and Enlil a son was born; Nannar, the Bright One, Ninlil him named. He was the first of the Anunnaki on Earth to be conceived,One of Nibiru's royal seed on an alien planet to be born!85
