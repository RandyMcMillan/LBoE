With eagerness Alalu bent down, together his hands he cupped, water to his mouth he brought. A coolness did the water have, a taste from Nibiru's water different.Once more he drank, then with fright he asunder jumped:A hissing sound he could hear; a slithering body by the poolside was moving!His carried weapon he seized, a blast of its ray toward the hissing he directed. The moving stopped, the hissing was ended.To examine the danger Alalu stepped forward.The slithered body lay still; dead was the creature, a sight most strange:Like a rope its long body was, without hands or feet was the body;Fierce eyes were in its small head, out of its mouth a long tongue was sticking.A sight on Nibiru never beheld it was, a creature of another world!Was it the orchard's guardian? Alalu by himself pondered. Was it the water's master? himself he asked.In his carried flask he some water collected; with alertness to the chariot he made his way. The sweet fruits he also picked; to the chariot he set his course.The brightness of the Sun's rays was greatly diminished; darkness it was as the chariot he reached.The shortness of the day Alalu pondered, its shortness him amazed.From the direction of the marshes a cool lightness on the horizon was rising. A white-hued ball in the heavens was quickly rising:Kingu, the Earth's companion, he now beheld.What in the accounts of the Beginning, his eyes the truth could now see: The planets and their circuits, the Hammered Bracelet,Ki the Earth, Kingu its moon, all created were, all by names were called!In his heart Alalu knew one more truth a beholding needed:The gold, the means of salvation, to be found was needed.43
