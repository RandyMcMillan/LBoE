As his Rank of Thirty befitting, as the god of the Moon Nannar was worshiped;As the count of the Moon months in a year, twelve festivals each year he decreed,To each of the twelve great Anunnaki a month and its festival were dedicated.Throughout the First Region to the Anunnaki gods, great and lesser ones,Shrines and sanctuaries were built, the people to their gods could directly pray.In the First Region, civilization from Ki-Engi to other neighboring lands spread,In Cities of Man local rulers as Righteous Shepherds were designated;Artisans and farmers, shepherds and weavers their products far and wide exchanged,Laws of justice were decreed, contracts of trade, of espousal and divorce were honored.In schools the young ones studied, scribes hymns and proverbs and wisdom recorded.Abundance and happiness were in the lands; quarrels and encroachments there also were.All the while Inanna in her skyship from land to land roamed; near the Upper Sea with Utu she frolicked.To the domain of her uncle Ishkur she went, Dudu, Beloved, she called him.To the people who in the upper plain of the two rivers dwelt Inanna took a liking;The sound of their tongue she found pleasant, to speak their language she learned.By the name of the planet Lahamu in their tongue Ishtar they called her,Uruk her city Unug-ki they called, Dudu as Adad in their language they pronounced.Sin, Lord of Oracles, her father Nannar they named; Urim-city by them Ur was called. Shamash, Bright Sun, in their tongue Utu they called, him too they worshiped.Enlil by them Father Elil was called, Nippur by them was Nibru-ki;Ki-Engi, Land of the Lofty Watchers, Shumer in their language was named.In Shumer, the First Region, kingship between the cities was rotated;In the Second Region, diversity by Ra was not permitted, alone to reign he wished.The eldest of Heaven, firstborn who is on Earth! Thus by the priests to be known he wanted.223
