A daughter of Enkime my fancy caught, her to espouse I wish!Ninki her son's words pondered. And the maiden, does she your gaze appreciate? So did she Marduk ask.Indeed she does, Marduk to his mother said.This is not the matter to consider! Enki with a raised voice said.If our son this shall do, to Nibiru with his spouse he would never go,His princely rights on Nibiru he forever will forsake!To this Marduk with a bitter laughter responded: My rights on Nibiru are nonexistent,Even on Earth my rights as Firstborn have been trampled.This indeed is my decision: From prince a king on Earth become, the master of this planet!Let it so be! Ninki said. Let it so be! Enki also said.They summoned Matushal, the bride's brother; of Marduk's wish they him told.Humbled but with joy overwhelmed Matushal was. Let it so be! he said.When of the decision Enlil was told, with fury he was seized.It was one thing for the father with Earthlings intercourse have,It is another matter for the son an Earthling to espouse, lordship on her to bestow!When Ninmah of the matter was told, greatly disappointed she was.Marduk any maiden of ours could espouse, even from my own daughters by Enki he could chose,Half sisters, as is the royal custom, he could espouse! So did Ninmah say.With fury Enlil to Anu on Nibiru of the matter words beamed up:Too far has this behavior gone, it cannot be allowed! to Anu the king Enlil said.On Nibiru Anu the counselors summoned, the matter with urgency to discuss.In the rule books of such a matter no rule they found.Anu the savants also summoned, the matter's consequences to discuss.On Nibiru Adapa, the maiden's progenitor, could not stay! to Anu they were saying.151
