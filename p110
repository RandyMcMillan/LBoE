Let the males the females insemiante, let them by themselves offspring beget!So were they to each other saying.As for Adamu and Ti-Amat, from the toil of the excavations they shall be protected,Let us them to the Edin being over, to the Anunnaki therein our handiwork display!So was Enki to the others saying; with that the others did concur.To Eridu, in the Edin the city of Enki, Adamu and Ti-Amat were taken.An abode in an enclosure for them was built, to roam therein they could.The Anunnaki of the Edin came to see them, from the Landing Place they came.Enlil came to see them; by the sight his displeasure was diminished.Ninurta came to see them; Ninlil did as well.From the way station on Lahmu Marduk the son of Enki also came down to see.It was a sight most astounding, a wonder of wonders it was to behold!Your hands have made it, the Anunnaki to the fashioners were saying.The Igigi who between Earth and Lahmu shuttled were also all agog.Primitive Workers have been fashioned, our days of toil to end! So were they, all saying.In the Abzu the newborns were growing, for their maturing the Anunnaki were anticipating.Enki was the supervisor, Ninmah and Ningishzidda also came.In the excavations the Anunnaki were grumbling, patience to impatience gave way.Ennugi, their overseer, of Enki was often inquiring; for Primitive Workers the outcry he conveyed.The circuits of Earth grew in number, maturity of the Earthlings was overdue; No conceiving among the females was observed, there was no birth-giving!By the cages among the trees Ningishzidda a couch of grass for himself made; Day and night the Earthlings he was watching, their doings to ascertain. Indeed he saw them mating, the males the females were inseminating!110
