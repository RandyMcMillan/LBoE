Let us it as a way station consider, let me and Marduk thereto journey!The two plans Anu the king before counselors and savants for considering presented.Let the Moon be first examined! the king they did advise.Let the Moon be first examined! Anu to Enki and Enlil the decision beamed.Enki was greatly joyed; the Moon to him always was alluring,Whether somewhere waters it is hiding, what atmosphere it possesses he did always wonder.In sleepless nights its silvery cool disk with bewitchment he observed,Its waxing and waning, a game with the Sun played, a wonder of wonders he deemed.What secrets from the Beginning it held he wished to uncover.In a rocketship did Enki and Marduk to the Moon Journey;Thrice they the Earth's companion encircled, the deep wound by the dragon caused they observed.By many hollows, the handiwork of smashing demons, was the Moon's face marked. In a place of rolling hills they set the rocketship down, in its midst they landed; From the place the Earth they could observe, and the expanse of the heavens. Eagles' helmets they had to don; the atmosphere was for breathing insufficient. With ease they walked about, in this and that direction they went;The evil dragon's handiwork was dryness and desolation.Unlike Lahmu it is, for a way station it is unsuitable! to his father Marduk was saying. Let us abandon this place, let us to Earth return!Do not be hasty, my son! So was Enki to Marduk saying.Are you not by the celestial dance of Earth and Moon and Sun enchanted? Unobstructed from here is the viewing the quarter of the Sun is at hand,The Earth like a globe in the void by nothing is hanging.With our instruments we can scan the distant heavens,119
