Enough! Enough! to all that I say. The abominations cannot continue!Now that a calamity by a destiny unknown has been ordained,Let what must happen, happen! So did Enlil angrily proclaim;That all leaders solemnly swear to let events unhindered occur, of all Enlil demanded. First to take the oath of silence was Ninurta; others of Enlil's side followed.Nergal of Enki's sons was first to take the oath; others of Enki's sons followed.To your command I bow! Marduk to Enlil said. But of what worth is the swearing?If Igigi their spouses will abandon, would not the fear among the Earthlings spread?Ninmah was in tears; the words of the oath she faintly whispered.Enlil at his brother Enki gazed. It is the wish of king and council! to him he said.Why will you bind me with an oath? Enki his brother Enlil asked.The decision by you was made, on Earth it is a commandment!The floodwaters I cannot arrest, the Earthling multitudes I cannot save,To what oath to bind me you therefore desire? So did Enki his brother ask.To let it all happen as if by fate decreed, let it as Enlil's Decision be known,On Enlil alone let the responsibility forever rest! So did Enki to all pronounce.Then Enki from the assembly departed; Marduk with him also left.With quick words of command Enlil the assembly to order broughtTasks for what was to be done he with firm decisions assigned,Between those who will depart and those who will stay the grouping arrange,Places for assembly to designate, equipment to collect, chariots to assign.First to depart were those who to Nibiru were returning,With much embracing and the locking of arms, in joy mixed with sorrow, the celestial boats they boarded;One after the other the vehicles from Sippar roared aloft.163
