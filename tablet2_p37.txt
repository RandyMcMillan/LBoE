His course became upset, his doings were confused.Tiamat's band tightly her encircled, with terror they trembled.Tiamat to her roots gave a shudder, a mighty roar she emitted;On Nibiru she cast a spell, engulfed him with her charms.The issue between them was joined, the battle was unavoided!Face to face they came, Tiamat and Nibiru; against each other they were advancing.They for battle approached, they pressed on for single combat.The Lord spread his net, to encompass her he cast it;With fury Tiamat cried out, like one possessed she lost her senses.The Evil Wind, which had been behind him, Nibiru drove forward, in her face he let it loose; She opened her mouth the Evil Wind to swallow, but could not close her lips.The Evil Wind charged her belly, into her innards it made its way.Her innards were howling, her body was distended, her mouth was open wide.Through the opening Nibiru shot a brilliant arrow a lightning most divine.It pierced her innards, her belly it tore apart;It tore into her womb, it split apart her heart.Having thus subdued her, her life-breath he extinguished.The lifeless body Nibiru surveyed, like a slaughtered carcass Tiamat now was.Beside their lifeless mistress, her eleven helpers trembled with terror;In Nibiru's net they were captured, unable they were to flee.Kingu, who by Tiamat was made the host's chief, was among them.The Lord put him in fetters, to his lifeless mistress he bound him.He wrested from Kingu the Tablets of Destinies, unrightly to him given,Stamped it with his own seal, fastened the Destine to his own chest.37
