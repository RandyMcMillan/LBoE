The people of Ziusudra's middle son, Ham, to inhabit it were chosen.To make Marduk their lord, of their lands the master, Enki to appease his son suggested. By your wish let it so be! Enlil to Enki about it said.In Tilmun, in its mountainous south, an abode for Ninmah his mother Ninurta built;Near a spring with date trees, a verdant valley, it was located,The mountain peak Ninurta terraced, a fragrant garden for Ninmah he planted.When all was thus completed, a signal to all outposts on Earth was given:From the mountainlands across the ocean Whirlwinds the gold nuggets brought,From the Place of the Celestial Chariots to Nibiru the gold was lofted.On that memorable day Enlil and Enki to each other said and agreed:Let us Ninmah, the peacemaker, with a new epithet-name honor:Ninharsag, Mistress of the Mountainhead, let us name her!By acclamation was Ninmah the honor given, henceforth Ninharsag she was called. Praise to Ninharsag, on Earth the peacemaker! in unison the Anunnaki proclaimed.Synopsis of the Eleventh TabletThe spaceport's land, Tilmun, is declared a neutral zoneIt is granted to Ninmah, who is renamed Ninharsag Marduk gets the Dark Lands, the Enlilites the Olden Lands Marduk's grandsons quarrel, Satu murders Asar Impregnating herself, Asar's wife Asta bears HoronIn aerial battles over Tilmun, Horon vanquishes SatuThe Enlilites deem it prudent to prepare another spaceport Enki's son Dumuzi and Inanna, Enlil's granddaughter, fall in love Fearing the consequences, Marduk causes Dumuzi's death183
