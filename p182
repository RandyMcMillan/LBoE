The image of Ningishzidda, the peaks' designer, let its face be,Let it precisely toward the Place of the Celestial Chariots gaze,When, by whom, and the purpose let it to future generations reveal!So did Enki to Enlil suggest. To the words Enlil consented and to Enki said:Of the Place of the Celestial Chariots, Utu must again the commander be;Let the gazing lion, precisely eastward facing, with Ningishzidda's image be!When the work to cut and shape the lion from the bedrock was proceeding,Marduk to his father Enki words of aggrievement said:To dominate the whole Earth to me did you promise,Now command and glory to others are granted, without task or dominion I am left.In my erstwhile domain are the artificed mounts situated, on the lion the image mine must be!By these words of Marduk Ningishzidda was angered, the other sons were also annoyed,By the clamor for domains Ninurta and his brothers were also aroused,Lands for themselves and devoted Earthlings everyone was demanding!Let not the celebration a contest become! Ninmah amidst the raised voices shouted.The Earth is still in havoc, we Anunnaki are few, of the Earthlings there are only survivors!Let Marduk Ningishzidda of the honor not deprive, let us Marduk's words also heed!So did Ninmah, the peacemaker, to the contending leaders say.For peace to prevail, the habitable lands between us should be apart set! Enlil to Enki said.To make the peninsula an uncontested divider they agreed, to the peacemaker Ninmah they it allotted.Tilmun, Land of the Missiles, they named it; to Earthlings it was beyond bounds.The habitable lands to the east thereof to Enlil and his offspring were set apart,For the descendants of two sons of Ziusudra, Shem and Yafet, therein to dwell.The dark-hued landmass that the Abzu included to Enki and his clan was for domains granted,182
