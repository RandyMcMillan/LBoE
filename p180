Twin adjoining peaks Enlil selected, on them the southern delimit he anchored.Where the second set of twin peaks was required, mountains there were none,Only a flatland above the water-clogged valley from the ground protruded.Artificial peaks thereon we can raise! So did Ningishzidda to the leaders say.On a tablet the image of smooth-sided, skyward rising peaks for them he drew.If it can be done, let it so be! Enlil with approval said. Let them also as beacons serve! On the flatland, above the river's valley, Ningishzidda a scale model built,The rising angles and four smooth sides with it he perfected.Next to it a larger peak he placed, its sides to Earth's four corners he set;By the Anunnaki, with their tools of power, were its stones cut and erected.Beside it, in a precise location, the peak that was its twin he placed;With galleries and chambers for pulsating crystals he designed it.When this artful peak to the heavens rose, to place upon it the capstone the leaders were invited.Of electrum, an admixture by Gibil fashioned, was the Apex Stone made.The sunlight to the horizon it reflected, by night like a pillar of fire it was,The power of all the crystals to the heavens in a beam it focused.When the artful works, by Ningishzidda designed, were completed and ready,The Anunnaki leaders the Great Twin Peak entered, at what they saw they marveled; Ekur, House Which Like a Mountain is, they named it, a beacon to the heavens it was. That the Anunnaki the Deluge survived and prevailed forever it proclaimed.Now the new Place of the Celestial Chariots gold from across the seas can receive, From it the chariots to Nibiru the gold for survival shall carry;From it to the east, where the Sun on the designated day rises, they will ascend,To it to the southwest, where the Sun on the designated day sets, they will descend!180
