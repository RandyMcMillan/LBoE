When three leagues aloft they were, again they cast a glance whence they had departed; The Earth was now as a small ball, by a sea of darkness in the vastness swallowed.Once again Adapa agitated was; he cowered and cried Out: Take me back! he shouted. Ningishzidda his hand on the neck of Adapa put; in an instant was Adapa quiet.When they on Nibiru landed, there was much curiosity,The children of Enki, on Earth born, to see, even more so an Earthling to encounter:A being from another world on Nibiru has arrived! So were the crowds shouting.With Ilabrat to the palace they were taken to be washed and with perfumed oils anointed.Fresh and befitting garments they were given;Heeding Enki's words, Adapa the new clothing did put on.In the palace nobles and heroes milled about, in the throne room, princes and counselors gathered.To the throne room by Ilabrat they were led, Adapa behind him, then the two sons of Enki. In the throne room before Anu the king they bowed; from his throne Anu stepped forward. My grandsons! My grandsons! he cried out. He hugged Dumuzi, he hugged Ningishzidda, With tears in his eyes he embraced them, he kissed them.To his right Dumuzi he bade to be seated, on his left Ningishzidda sat.Then llabrat to Anu the Earthling Adapa presented.Does he our speech understand? Anu the king of Ilabrat inquired.Indeed he does, by the lord Enki was he taught! Ilabrat so answered.Come hither! Anu to Adapa said. What is your name and your occupation?Forward Adapa stepped, again he bowed: Adapa is my name, of the lord Enki a servant! So did Adapa in words speak; his speaking great amazement was causing.A wonder of wonders on Earth has been attained! Anu declared.A wonder of wonders on Earth has been attained! all the assembled shouted.134
