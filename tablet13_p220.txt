The gods are among us, death they can abolish! So to each other the people said.On the throne of Unug-ki Banda his father Enmerkar succeeded; Lugal, Great Man, his title was.The goddess Ninsun, of Enlil's seed, took him to be her spouse,The hero Gilgamesh, their son, on the throne of Unug-ki Lugal-Banda followed.As the years passed and Gilgamesh older grew, of life and death to his mother Ninsun he spoke,About the death of his forebears, though of Anunnaki descended, he wondered. Do gods die? his mother he asked.Shall I too, though two thirds divine, as a mortal over the wall climb? So to her he said.As long as on Earth you abide, the death of an Earthling will you overwhelm! Ninsun to her son said.But if to Nibiru you will be taken, long life thereon you will attain!To take Gilgamesh aloft, to Nibiru journey, Ninsun to Utu the commander appealed,Endlessly Ninsun to Utu appealed, day after day with him she pleaded:Let Gilgamesh to the Landing Place go! Utu in the end agreed.To guide and protect him, Ninharsag a double of Gilgamesh fashioned.Enkidu, As by Enki Created, was he called, of a womb he was not born, blood in his veins was not.With the comrade Enkidu Gilgamesh to the Landing Place journeyed, Utu with oracles his progress oversaw;At the entrance to the cedar forest, its fire-belching monster their way blocked.With trickery they the monster confused, to pieces it they broke.When the secret entrance to the tunnels of the Anunnaki they found,By the Bull of Heaven, a creature of Enlil, with deathly snorts they were challenged.To the gates of Unug-ki the monster them chased; at the city's ramparts by Enkidu it was smitten.When Enlil this heard, with agony he cried, in the heavens of Anu was his wailing heard; For in his heart Enlil well knew: Bad indeed was the omen!For having the Bull of Heaven slain, to perish in waters Enkidu was punished;220
