The others of Tiamat's band as captives he bound, in his circuit he them ensnared. He trampled them underfoot, cut them up to pieces.He bound them all to his circuit; to turn around he made them, backward to course. From the Place of the Battle Nibiru then departed,To the gods who had him appointed the victory to announce.He made a circuit about Apsu, to Kishar and Anshar lie journeyed.Gaga came out to greet him, as a herald to the others he then journeyed.Beyond An and Antu, Nibiru to the Abode in the Deep proceeded.The fate of lifeless Tiamat and of Kingu he then considered,To Tiamat, whom he had subdued, the Lord Nibiru then returned.He made his way to her, paused to view her lifeless body;To artfully divide the monster in his heart lie was planning.Then, as a mussel, into two parts he split her, her chest from her lower parts he separated. Her inner channels he cut apart, her golden veins he beheld with wonder.Trodding upon her hinder part, the Lord her upper part completely severed.The North Wind, his helper, from his side he summoned,To thrust away the severed head the Wind he commanded, in the void to place it.Nibiru Wind upon Tiamat then hovered, sweeping upon her gushing waters.Nibiru shot a lightning, to North Wind he gave a signal;In a brilliance was Tiamat's upper part to a region unknown carried.With her the bound Kingu was also exiled, of the severed part a companion to be.The hinder part's fate Nibiru then considered:As an everlasting trophy of the battle he wished it to be,A constant reminder in the heavens, the Place of the Battle to enshrine.38
