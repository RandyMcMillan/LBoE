Therefore to keep to myself the words of Galzu I decidedWas he truly the Creator of All's emissary, was he my hallucination?Let whatever has to happen, happen! so to myself I said.To his brother's words Enki listened, his head up and down he nodded.The First Region is desolate, the Second Region is in confusion, the Third Region is wounded,The Place of the Celestial Chariots is no more; that is what has happened! Enki to Enlil said.If that was the will of the Creator of All, that is what of our Mission to Earth remained!By the ambitions of Marduk was the seed sown, what the crop resulted is for him to reap!So did Enlil to his brother Enki say, then he the triumph of Marduk accepted.Let the rank of fifty, by me for Ninurta intended, to Marduk instead be given,Let Marduk over the desolation in the Regions his supremacy declare!As for me and Ninurta, we will in his way no longer stand.To the Lands Beyond the Oceans we will depart, what we had all had come for,The mission to obtain for Nibiru gold we will complete!So did Enlil to Enki say; dejection was in his words.Would different matters have been were the Weapons of Terror unused? Enki his brother challenged.Should we have the words of Galzu to Nibiru not return heeded? Enlil retorted. Should Earth Mission been stopped when the Anunnaki mutinied?I what I did did, you what you did did. The past undone cannot become!Is not in that too a lesson? Enki asked them both.Is not what on Earth happened, what on Nibiru had taken place mirrored? Is not in that tale of the Past the outline of the Future written-Will Mankind, in our image created, our attainments and failures repeat? Enlil was silent. As he stood up to leave, Enki to him his arm extended.236
