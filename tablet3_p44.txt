If truth be in the Beginning tales, if by the waters the golden veins of Tiamat were washed, In the waters of Ki, its cut-off half, gold must be found!With hands unsteady Alalu the Tester from the chariot's pole dismantled.With trembling hands the Fish's suit he donned, the fast arriving daylight eagerly awaiting. At daybreak the chariot he exited, to the marshes he quickly stepped.Into deeper waters he waded, the Tester into the waters he inserted.Its illuminated face he eagerly watched, in his chest his heart was pounding.The water's contents was the Tester indicating, by symbols and numbers its findings disclosing.Then Alalu's heartbeat stopped: There is gold in the waters, the Tester was telling!Unsteady on his legs Alalu stepped forward, deeper into the marshes he made his way.Again he the Tester into the waters inserted; again the Tester gold announced!A cry, a cry of triumph, from Alalu's throat emanated: Nibiru's fate in his hands now was!Back to the chariot he made his way, the Fish's suit off he took, the commander's seat he occupied.The Tablets of Destinies that knows all circuits he enlivened, to Nibiru's circuit to find the direction.The Speaker-of-Words he stirred up, toward Nibiru the words to carry. Then to Nibiru words he uttered, thus he was saying:The words of the great Alalu to Anu on Nibiru are directed.On another world I am, the gold of salvation I have found;The fate of Nibiru is in my hands; to my conditions you must give heed!Synopsis of the Third TabletAlalu beams the news to Nibiru, reclaims the kingship Anu, astounded, puts the issue before the royal council Enlil, Anuâ€™s Foremost Son, suggests on-site verificationEa, Anu's Firstborn and a son-in-law of Alalu, is chosen instead44
