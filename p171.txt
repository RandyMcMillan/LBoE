The morning's light to darkness changed, as though by death's shadow veiled. Then the sound of a rolling thunder boomed, lightnings the skies lit up. Depart! Depart! Utu to the Anunnaki gave the signal.Crouched in the boats of heaven, the Anunnaki heavenward were lofted.In Shurubak, eighteen leagues away, the bright eruptions by Ninagal were seen: Button up!
