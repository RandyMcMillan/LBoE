With him the seeds of Nibiru of grains which multiply to Earth will be sent;Dumuzi, the youngest, for a Shar with us shall stay,Then to Earth with ewes and the essence of sheep he shall return!This was the decision of Anu, to the king's words all in agreement their head, bowed.At the appointed time Ningishzidda and Adapa to the Place of the Celestial Chariot; were taken. Anu and Dumuzi, llabrat and counselors, nobles and heroes to them farewell bade.There was roaring and shuddering, and the chariot was lofted;The planet Nibiru grow smaller they saw then from horizon to zenith the heavens they saw. On their journey Ningishzidda to Adapa the planet gods explained.Of Sun and Earth arid the moon to him lessons he gave,Of how the months chase one another and how Earth's year is counted him he taught.When to Earth they returned, to his father Enki Ningishzidda all that had happened related. Enki laughed and struck his loins: it all went as I expected with glee he said;Except the detention of Dumuzi, that is a puzzle! So did Enki say.By the prompt return of Ningishzidda and Adapa Enlil was greatly puzzled,What is the matter, what on Nibiru transpired? of Enki and Ningishzidda he inquired.Let Ninmah too be summonded, let her too of what transpired hear! Enki to him said.After Ninmah arrived, to Enlil and to her Ningishzidda all did tell.Enki his cohabitation with the Earthling females also related;No rules have I broken, our satiation I have ensured! So Enki to them said.No rules did you break, the fates of Anunnaki and Earthlings by a rash deed you determined! So did Enlil in anger say. Now the lot is cast, destiny by fate is overtaken!With fury was Enlil seized, with anger he turned and left them standing.To Eridu Marduk came, by his mother Damkina was he summoned.137
