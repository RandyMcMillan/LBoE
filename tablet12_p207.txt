To a place nearby Ninurta to Anu and Antu an artificed mound showed,How to a place for melting and refining metals it was made Ninurta explained.How a new metal from stones was extracted he showed them: Anak, Anunnaki-made, he called it,How by combining it with the abundant copper a strong metal he invented, he showed them. On the great lake, from whose shores the metals came, Anu and Antu sailed;The Lake of Anak Anu called it, henceforth this was its name.Then from lands from the north, lands where great horned beasts are hunted,Marduk before his father Enki and his grandfather Anu came; Nabu his son with him was. When Enki about Sarpanit inquired, Marduk with sorrow of her death them told.Now Nabu alone with me has remained! to his father and grandfather Marduk said.Anu Marduk to his chest pressed: Enough you have been punished! to him he said;With his right hand on Marduk's head, Anu Marduk to be forgiven blessed.From the golden place, high in the mountains, all who had gathered to the plain below went.There, stretching to the horizon, Ninurta a new place for the chariots has prepared.Anu and Antu's celestial chariot stood there ready, with gold to the brim it was loaded.As the time for departing came, Anu to his children words of good-bye and guidance said:Whatever Destiny for the Earth and the Earthlings intended, let it so be!If Man, not Anunnaki, to inherit the Earth is destined, let us destiny help.Give Mankind knowledge, up to a measure secrets of heaven and Earth them teach,Laws of justice and righteousness teach them, then depart and leave!So did Anu to his children fatherly instructions give.Once more they hugged, embraced and kissed, and from the new chariots' place Anu and Antu for Nibiru left.The first to break the sorrowed silence was Marduk; with anger were his words:What is this new Place of Celestial Chariots? of the others an explanation he demanded.207
