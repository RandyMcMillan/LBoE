By the circuit of the heavens, from horizon to horizon, he drew images of twelve constellations. In the Great Band, the Way of Anu, one each with the Sun's family of twelve he paired,To each one he designated a station, by names they were to be called.Then in the heavens below the Way of Anu, whence Nibiru the Sun is approaching,A bandlike way he designed, the Way of Enki he it designated;To it twelve constellations by their shapes he also allotted.The heavens above the Way of Anu, the Upper Tier, the Way of Enlil he called,Therein too the stars into twelve constellations he assembled.Thirty-six were the stars' constellations, in the three Ways were they located.So will the Earth's position designated as around the Sun it travels!The start of the cycle, of Celestial Time the measure, Enki to Marduk Indicated:When on Earth I had arrived, the station that was ending by me the Station of the Fishes was named,The one that followed after my name title, He of the Water., I called!So Enki with satisfaction and pride to his son Marduk was sayingYour wisdon the heavens embraces, your teachings any own understanding extend,But on Earth and on Nibiru, knowledge and rulership are separated! So did Marduk to his father say.My son! My son! What is that you do not know, what is it that you are missing? to him Enki was saying.The secrets of the heavens, the secrets of the Earth with you have I shared!Alas, my father! Marduk was saying. There was agony in his voice.When the Anunnaki in the Abzu the toil ceased and the Primitive Worker you set to fashion, Not my mother but Ninmah, the mother of Ninurta, to assist you was summoned,Not I but Ningishzidda, of me the younger, to help you was invited,With them, not with me, your knowledge of life and death did you share!121
