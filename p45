Ea ingeniously equips the celestial boat for the journey The spaceship, piloted by Anzu, carries fifty heroes Overcoming perils, the Nibiruans thrill by Earth's sight Guided by Alalu, they splash down and wade ashore Eridu, Home Away from Home, is established in seven days Extraction of gold from the waters beginsThrough the quantity is minuscule, Nibiru demands delivery Abgal, a pilot, chooses Alaluâ€™s spaceship for the trip Forbidden nuclear weapons are discovered in the spaceship Ea and Abgal remove the weapons of terror and hide themTHE THIRD TABLETThe fate of Nibiru is in my hands; to my conditions you must give heed!Those were the words of Alalu, from dark-hued Earth to Nibiru they were by the Speaker beamed.When the words of Alalu to Anu, the king, were conveyed,Anu astounded was; astounded were the counselors, amazed were the sages.Alalu is not dead? they each other asked. Could indeed he on another world be living? they with disbelief were saying.Was he not on Nibiru hiding, in the chariot to a place of concealment gone?The commanders of chariots were summoned, savants the beamed words considered.The words from Nibiru did not come; from beyond the Hammered Bracelet were they spoken, This was their finding, this to Anu the king they reported.Stunned was Anu; the happening he pondered.Let words of acknowledgment to Alalu be sent, to the assembled he was saying.45
