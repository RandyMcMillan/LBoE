Though evil did Marduk instigate, by ill fate, not by Marduk's hand, did Dumuzi die; Marduk is my firstborn, Ninki is his mother, for succession he is destined,From death by Ninurta's gang by us all he must be protected! So did Enki say. Only Gibil and Ninagal their father's call heeded; Ningishzidda was opposed,Nergal was hesitant: Only if in mortal danger he will be will I help! he said.It was after that that a war, of ferocity unknown, between the two clans erupted.Unlike the contending of Horon and Satu, of Earthlings descended, it was:A battle between Anunnaki, Nibiruan-born among them, on another planet was loosed.By Inanna was the warfare begun, in her skyship to the domains of Enki's sons she crossed over;Marduk to battle she challenged, to the domains of Ninagal and Gibil she him pursued.To assist her Ninurta from his Storm Bird withering beams at the enemy's strongholds shot, Ishkur from the skies with scorching lightnings and smashing thunders attacked.In the Abzu from the rivers fish he washed away, cattle in the fields he dispersed.To the north, the place of the artificed mounts, Marduk then retreated;Pursuing him, Ninurta on the habitations poison-bearing missiles rained.His Weapon That Tears Apart the people in those lands robbed of their senses,The canals that the river's waters bore, red from blood became;Ishkur's brilliances the nights' darkness into flaming days converted.As the devastating battles northward advanced, Marduk in the Ekur himself ensconced,Gibil for it an unseen shield devised, Nergal to heaven its all-seeing eye raised.With a Weapon of Brilliance, by a horn directed, Inanna the hiding place attacked;Horon to defend his grandfather came; by her Brilliance was his right eye damaged.While Utu the Igigi and their horde of Earthlings beyond Tilmun held off,At the foot of the artificed mounts Anunnaki, this and that clan supporting, in battle clashed.195
