By Inannn was the bitter end started, Marduk as Ra with Destiny tangled; Ninurta and Nergal the unspeakable end with their own hands delivered!Why was lnanna with her granted domain not satisfied, why to Marduk did unforgiving she remain?Journeying between Unug-ki and Aratta, Inanna restless and ungratified was;For her beloved Dumuzi she still mourned, her love's desire unquenched remained.When she flew about, in the sunrays Dumuzi's image she saw shimmering and beckoning, In the nighttime in dream-visions he appeared; I will return! he was saying.The glories of his domain in the Lard of two Narrows to her he was promising.In the sacred precinct of Unug-ki, a House for Nighttime Pleasure she established.To this Gigunu young heroes, on the night of their weddings, with sweet words she lured: Long life, a blissful future to them she promised; that her lover Dumuzi was she imagined. Each one in the morning in her bed was found dead.It was at that time that the hero Banda, left for dead, alive to Unug-ki returned!By the grace of Utu, of whose seed he was, did Banda from the dead return.A miracle! A miracle! excited Inanna shouted. My beloved Dumuzi to me came back!In her abode Banda was bathed, with a sash a fringed cloak on him was fastened. Dumuzi, my beloved! she called him. To her bed, with flowers bedecked, she lured him. When in the morning Banda was alive, with joy Inanna shouted:The power of not dying in my hands was placed, immortality by me is granted!Then to call herself a goddess Inanna decided, the Power of Immortality it implied. Nannar and Ningal, Inanna's parents, by her proclamation were not pleased;Enlil and Ninurta by Inanna's words were disconcerted; Utu, her brother, was bemused; The dead to revive is not possible! Enki and Ninharsag to each other said.In the lands of Ki-Engi, the people their good fortune praised:219
