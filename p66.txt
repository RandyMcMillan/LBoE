They went back to Endu; what they had found they contemplated.Eridu new tasks must be given, alone on Earth it cannot continue!Thus was Enlil saying; a great plan he described, a wide mission he was proposing:More heroes to bring over, more settlements to establish,The gold from Earth's innards to obtain, the gold from the admixture to separate,By skyships and chariots to be carried, from landing places tasks to perform.Who of the settlements in charge will be, who of the Abzu shall take command?Thus was Ea of Enlil asking.Who of enlarged Eridu shall take command, who the settlements shall oversee?Thus was Alalu saying.Who of the skyships and the landing place shall take command? So did Anzu inquire.Let Anu come to Earth, let him decisions provide! Thus did Enlil say in answer.Now this is the account of how Anu to Earth came,How lots with Ea and Enlil were drawn, how Ea the title-name Enki was given,How Alalu for the second time with Anu wrestled.To Earth in a celestial chariot did Anu journey; the route by the planets it followed.Around Lahmu Nungal, the pilot, a circuit made; by Anu was it closely observed.The Moon, the one who Kingu once had been, they circled and admired.Perchance gold thereon can also be found? in his heart Anu wondered.In the waters beside the marshlands his chariot splashed down;Ea for the arrival reed boats prepared, for Anu to arrive by sailing.Above the sky chambers were hovering, a royal welcome they were offering.In the lead boat Ea himself was afloat, the king his father the first to be greeting.Before Anu he bowed, then Anu embraced him. My son, my Firstborn! Anu to him shouted.66
