Of salvation by water's gold they were reassuring,Shar after Shar all of us salvation were expecting,Now different words we are hearing, a task beyond imagining to undertake,Proof of the golden veins is needed, a plan for success must be ensured!So was Enlil to the assembly saying; to his words many in agreement listened.Let Enlil go to Earth! Anu was saying. Let him proof obtain, a plan put forward;His words shall be heeded, his words a command shall be!In unanimity the assembly its consent gave, Enlil's mission it approved.With Alalgar, his chief lieutenant, Enlil for Earth departed; Alalgar his pilot was.With each a sky chamber were the two of them provided.To Earth the words of Anu, the king, words of decisions were beamed:Enlil of the mission in command shall be, his word shall be the command!When Enlil on Earth arrived, Ea with his half brother warmly locked arms,As brother meets brother Ea Enlil did welcome.To Alalu Enlil made a bowing, Alalu with weak words him bade welcome.The heroes to Enlil words of warm welcome were shouting; of the commander much they were expecting.Deftly Enlil the sky chambers to be assembled did command,In a sky chamber he went asoaring; Alalgar, his chief lieutenant, was as the pilot with him.Ea in a sky chamber, by Abgal piloted, to them to the Abzu showed the way.They surveyed the dry lands, of the oceans they took careful notice.From the Upper Sea to the Lower Sea the lands they scanned,Of all that was above and that was below they took account.In the Abzu the soil they tested. Gold there was indeed; with much soil and rocks it was commixed,Refined as in the waters it was not, in an admixture it was hiding.65
