More settlements to establish, of the skyships and their heroes charge to take, Of all the lands until they the bar of the seas encounter, the leader to be.To Ea the seas and the oceans as his domain were granted,Lands beyond the bar of the waters by him to be governed,In the Abzu to be the master, with ingenuity the gold to procure.Enlil with the lots was agreeable, the hand of fate he with a bow accepted.Ea's eyes filled with tears, of Eridu and the Edin he wished not to be parted.Let Ea forever Eridu as his home retain! Anu to Enlil was saying,Let his being the first to splash down forever be remembered,Let Ea as Earth's master be known; Enki, Earth's Master, let his title be!His father's words Enlil with a bow accepted; to his brother he thus said:Enki, Earth's Master, your title name shall henceforth be; I Lord of the Command shall be known.To the heroes in assembly Anu, Enki, and Enlil the decisions announced.The tasks are assigned, success is in the offing! Anu to them was saying.Now farewell I can bid you, to Nibiru with quiet heart I can return!Forward toward Anu Alalu stepped. A grave matter has been forgotten! he shouted.The mastery of Earth to me was allotted; that was the promise when the gold finds to Nibiru I announced!Nor have I the claim to Nibiru's throne forsaken,By Anu to share all with his sons, it is a grave abomination!Thus did Alalu Anu and the decision challenge.Without words was Anu in the beginning, then with anger he spoke up:By a second wrestling let our dispute be decided, let us the wrestling do here, let us do it now! With disdain Alalu took off his clothing; likewise did Anu unrobe.In nakedness did the two royals begin to grapple, a mighty struggle it was.69
