The thought of divine godship to him greatly appealed, to be a great god himself he announced! By what to Gilgamesh, in good measure an Earthling, was permitted, Ra was angered,But a clever way wherewith the loyalty of kings and people to retain he deemed it:If demigods the gateway to immortality are shown, let this to the kings of my region apply!So did Marduk, in the Second Region by the name Ra known, to himself words say:Let the kings of my Region of Neteru offspring be, to Nibiru in an Afterlife journey!So did Ra in his, realm decree. The kings how to build tombs facing eastward he taught,To the priest-scribes a long book he dictated, the Afterlife journey in detail in it was described. How to reach the Duat, the Place of the Celestial Boats, in the book was told,How to there, by a Stairway to Heaven, to the Imperishable Planet journey,Of the Plant of Life partake, the Waters of Youth to satiation drink.Of the coming of the gods to Earth by Ra were the priests taught,Gold is the splendor of Life, to them he said. The flesh of the gods it is! to the kings Ra said.To make expeditions to the Abzu and the Lower Domain, gold to obtain, the kings he instructed. When by the force of weapons the kings of Ra lands not theirs conquer,His brothers' realms he invaded, their ire he caused to arise and grow:What is Marduk up to, the brothers each other asked, that over us he tramples?To their father Enki they appealed; to Ptah his father Ra did not listen.To capture all adjoining lands the kings of Magan and Meluhha Ra directed,To be the master of the Four Regions was his heart's plan.The Earth is mine to rule! So adamantly to his father he said.Now this is the account of how Marduk supreme himself declared and Babili built,And how Inanna, warrior kings commanding, blood made flow and sacrileges allowed.After kingship to Urim from Unug-ki was transferred, Nannar and Ningal on the people smiled.222
