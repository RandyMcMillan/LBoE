Day and night I raised my opposing voice; peace 1 counseled, deploring haste.For the second time the people have raised his heavenly image; why does opposing continue? I asked in pleading.Have all the instruments been checked? Did not the era of Marduk in the heavens arrive? I once more inquired.Ningishzidda, my very son, other signs of heaven cited. His heart, I knew, Marduk's injustice to him could not forgive.Nannar, to Enlil on Earth born, was unrelenting too. Marduk my temple in the north city his own abode made! So he said.Ishkur, Enlil's youngest, punishment demanded; in my lands to whore after him the people he made! he said.Utu, son of Nannar, at Marduk's son Nabu his wrath directed: The Place of the Celestial Chariots he tried to seize!Inanna, twin of Utu, was furious of all; the punishment of Marduk for the killing of her beloved Dumuzi she still demanded.Ninharsag, mother of gods and men, her gaze diverted. Why is not Marduk here? she only said.Gibil, my own son, with gloom replied: Marduk has all entreaties put aside; by the signs of heaven his supremacy he claims!Only with weapons will Marduk be stopped! Ninurta, Enlil's firstborn, shouted.Utu about protecting the Place of the Celestial Chariots was concerned; in Marduk's hands it must not fall! So he said.Nergal, lord of the Lower Domain, ferociously was demanding: Let the olden Weapons of Terror for obliteration be used!At my own son I gazed in disbelief. For brother against brother the terror weapons have been foresworn!Instead of consent, there was silence.In the silence Enlil opened his mouth: Punishment there must be; like birds without wings the evildoers shall be,Marduk and Nabu us of heritage are depriving; let them of the Place of the Celestial Chariots be deprived!13
