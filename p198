Through a chiseled upper opening Marduk will be rescued! to the leaders he said. At a place which I will show them, a doorway in the stones they will cut,From it upward a twisting passageway they shall bore, a rescue shaft creating. Through hidden hollowings to the Ekur's midst they will continue,At the vortex of the hollowings through the stones they will break through.A doorway to the insides they will blow open, thereby the blockings circumventing;Up the grand gallery they will continue, the three stone bars they will raise,The uppermost chamber, Marduk's death prison, they will reach!Anunnaki, by Ningishzidda guided, his outlined plan then followed,With tools that crack the stones the opening they made, the rescue shaft they fashioned, The insides of the artificed mount they reached, an exit they blew open.Circumventing the three blocking stones, the uppermost chamber they reached.On a small platform the portcullises they raised; Marduk, fainted, they rescued.Carefully through the twisting shaft they the lord lowered, to fresh air they him brought; Outside Sarpanit and Nabu spouse and father were awaiting; a joyful reunion it was.When to Marduk his father Enki the terms of release conveyed,Marduk was enraged: I would rather die than my birthright forfeit! he shouted.Sarpanit into his arms Nabu thrust. We are part of your future! she softly said.Marduk was angered, Marduk was humbled. To Fate I yield! he inaudibly said.With Sarpanit and Nabu to a Land of No Return he departed,To a place where horned beasts are hunted with wife and son he wentAfter Marduk had departed, Ninurta the Ekur through the shaft reentered,Through a horizontal corridor to the Ekur's vulva he went.In its east wall, in a niche artfully fashioned, the Destiny Stone a red radiance was emitting.198
