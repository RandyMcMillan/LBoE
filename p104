In our image and after our likeness to be, perchance an Anunnaki womb is required! In the House of Life there was silence; words never before heard Enki was uttering! They gazed at each other, about what in each other's mind they were thinking.Wise are your words, my brother! Ninmah at long last was saying.Perchance the right admixture in the wrong womb was inserted;Now where is the female among the Anunnaki her womb to offer,Perchance the perfect Primitive Worker to create, perchance a monster in her belly to carry?So was Ninmah with a trembling voice saying.Let me of Ninki, my spouse, of that inquire! Enki was saying.Let us her to the House of Life summon, the matter before her lay outHe was turning to depart when Ninmah put her hand on his shoulder:No! No! to Enki she was saying.The admixtures by me were made, reward and endangerment should be mine!I shall be the one the Anunnaki womb to provide, for good or evil fate to face!Enki bowed his head, gently he embraced her. So be it! to her he said.In the clay vessel the admixture they made,The oval of an Earth female with Anunnaki male essence they put together;The fertilized egg into the womb of Ninmah by Enki was inserted; there was conception!The pregnancy, by an admixture conceived, how long will it last? to each other they wondered.Will it be nine months of Nibiru, will it be nine months of Earth?Longer than on Earth, quicker than on Nibiru, travail came; to a male child Ninmah birth was giving!Enki the boy child held in his hands; the image of perfection he was.He slapped the newborn on his hindparts; the newborn uttered proper sounds! He handed the newborn to Ninmah; she held him up in her hands.104
