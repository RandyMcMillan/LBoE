In the Abzu, at the tip the Whiteland facing, instruments far observing they installed;In the charge of Nergal, the son of Enki, and his spouse Ereshkigal the instruments ware putTo the Land Beyond the Seas Ninurta was assigned, in the mauntainland a Band Heaven-Earth to establish.On Lahmu the Igigi were restless; to pacify them Marduk was the task given:Until what are the hardships causing, the way station on Lahmu must be kept! So to Marduk the leaders said.The three who the fates decree with each other consulted;They looked at each other. How old the others are! each one of the others thought.Enki, who the death of Adapa was grieving, was the first one to speak.More than one hundred Shars since my arrival have passed! to his brother and sister he said.I was then a dashing leader; now bearded, tired, and old I am!An enthusiastic hero I was, for command and adventure ready! Enlil then said.Now I have children who have children, all on Earth born;Old on Earth we became, but those on Earth born are even older sooner!So did Enlil to his brother and sister ruefully say.As for me, an old sheep they call me! So did Ninmah wistfully say.While the others have been coming and going, turns on Earth to serve taking,We the leaders have stayed and stayed! Perchance it is time to leave! So did Enlil say.Of that did I often wonder, to them Enki was saying. Each time one of us three to revisit Nibiru wished,Word from Nibiru always our corning thereto prevented!Of that I too did wonder, Enlil was saying: Is it a thing on Nibiru, a thing on Earth? Perchance the life cycles that differ it concerns, so was Ninmah saying.To watch and see what transpires, the three leaders decided.At that time Fate, or was it Destiny? in its hands the matters took.149
