In the wombs of the birth-giving heroines the fertilized ovals were inserted. There was conception; with anticipation was the allotted time counted.At the allotted time, birth-givings Were occurring!At the allotted time, seven male Earthings were born,Their features were proper, good sounds they were uttering; by the heroines they were suckled. Seven Primitive Workers have been created! Ningishzidda was saying.Let the procedure be repeated: seven more the toil to undertake!My son! to him Enki was saving. Not even seven by seven sufficient shall be,Of heroine healers too much is required, forever their task this way shall be!Indeed, the task is too demanding, glow beyond enduring it is! Ninmah to their said.Female ones we have to fashion! Enki was saying, for males counterparts to be.Let them know each other, as one flesh the two to become,Let them by themselves procreate, on their own the childbirthing make,To Primitive Workers by themselves give birth, Anunnaki females to relieve!The ME formulas you must change, from male to female adjustment make! So did Enki to Nigishzidda say.For a counterpart to Adamu to be fashioned, in the womb of an Anunnaki female conception is needed!So did Ningishzidda to his father Enki in responding say.Enki at Ninmah his gaze directed; before she could speak, he raised his hand. Let me this time Ninki my spouse summon! With strong voice he said,If she is willing, let her the mold for the female Earthling create!They to the Abzu, to the House of Life, Ninki summoned,They showed her Adamu, all that matters to her they explained,Of the task that is required they gave explanations, of success and danger to her an account gave.107
