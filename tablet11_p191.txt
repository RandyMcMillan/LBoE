A bethrothal bed of gold by Gibil was fashioned, Nergal blue-hued lapis stones sent. Sweet dates, a fruit by Inanna favored, beside the bed they in a pile placed,Under the fruits the beads of lapis they hid for Inanna to discover.As the custom was, to perfume and clothe Inanna a sister of Dumuzi was sent, Geshtinanna, a sister-in-law-to-be, was her name.To her Inanna what was in her heart revealed, of her future with Dumuzi to her she said: A vision of a great nation I have, as a Great Anunnaki Dumuzi there will rise.His name over others shall be exalted, his queen-spouse I shall be.Princely status we will share, rebellious countries we shall together subdue,To Dumuzi I will status give, the country I will rightly direct!Inanna's visions of rulership and glory by Geshtinanna to her brother Marduk were reported. By Inanna's ambitions Marduk was greatly disturbed; to Geshtinanna a secret plan he told. To her brother Dumuzi, to the herder's dwelling, Geshtinanna went.Lovely to behold and perfumed, to her brother Dumuzi thus she said:Before with your young wife in your embrace with you will sleep,A legitimate heir, by a sister born, you must have!Inanna's son to succession shall not be entitled, on your mother's knees he will not be raised! She put his hand in her hand, she pressed her body against his body.My brother, with you I will lie down! Bridegroom, with you a peer of Enki we shall have!So did Geshtinanna to Dumuzi whisper, a noble issue from her womb to have.Into her womb Dumuzi poured the semen, by her caressing he fell asleep.During the night Dumuzi had a dream, a premonition of death he envisioned:In the dream seven evil bandits he saw coming into his dwelling.The Master has sent us for you, son of Duttur! to him they said.191
