Among the priests in the Nibru-ki temple Enlil of celestial savants inquired, Tirhu, an oracle priest, to him the high priest indicated.Of Ibru, of Arbakad the grandson, he was descended, sixth generation of Nibru-ki priests he was,With the royal daughters of Urim's kings they were intermarried.Get yourself to Nannar's temple in Urim, the heavens for celestial time observe:Seventy-two Earth years is the count of a Celestial Portion, the passage of three thereof carefully record!So did Enlil to Tirhu the priest say, the prophesied time he made him count.While Enlil the dream-vision and its portents pondered, Marduk from land to land went.Of his supremacy the people he was telling, to followers gain was his purpose.In the lands of the Upper Sea and the lands on Ki-Engi bordering,Nabu, Marduk's son, was the people inciting; to seize the Fourth Region was his plan.Between the dwellers of the west and the dwellers of the east clashes were occurring,Kings hosts of warriors formed, caravans ceased going, the walls of cities were raised.What Galzu had foretold indeed is happening! Enlil to himself said.Upon Tirhu and his sons, of worthy lineage descended, Enlil set his gaze:This is the man to choose, by Galzu indicated! Enlil to himself said.To Nannar, without the dream-vision revealing, Enlil to his son thus said:In the land between the rivers whence Arbakad had come, a city like Urim establish,A home-abode away from Urim let it for you and Ningal be.In its midst a temple-shrine establish, the Priest-Prince Tirhu in charge thereof appoint!By his father's word abiding, Nannar in the land of Arbakad the city of Harran established.To be high priest in its temple-shrine Tirhu he sent, his family with him;When two Celestial Portions out of the prophesied three were completed did Tirhu to Harran go. At that time Ur-Nammu, the joy of Urim, in the western lands from his chariot fell and died.228
