Let celestial boats be constructed, he decided, to seek the gold in the Hammered Bracelet, he decided.By the Hammered Bracelets the boats were crushed; none of them returned.Let with Weapons of Terror the bowels, of Nibirru be cut open, let volcanoes again erupt! he then commanded.With Weapons of Terror skyborne chariots were armed, with terror missiles from the skies were volcanoes struck.The mountains swayed, the valleys shuddered as great brilliances with thunder, exploded. In the land there was much rejoicing; of abundance there were expectations.In the palace, Anu was for Alalu the cupbearer.He would bow at Alalu's feet, set the drinking cup in Alalu's hand.Alalu was the king; Anu as a servant by him was treated.In the land rejoicing receded; rains were withheld, winds blew harder,The belching by volcanoes did not increase, the breach in the atmosphere did not heal.In the heavens Nibiru its circuits kept coursing; from circuit to circuit heat and cold grew harder to suffer.The people of Nibiru ceased to revere their king; instead of relief; misery he caused! Alalu on the throne remained seated.The strong and wise Anu, foremost among the princes, was standing before him.He would bow to Alalu's feet, set the drinking cup in Alalu's hand.For nine counted periods Alalu was king on Nibiru. In the ninth Shar, Anu gave battle to Alalu.To hand-to-hand combat, with bodies naked, Alalu he challenged. Let the winner be king, Anu said.They grappled with each other in the public square; doorposts trembled and walls shook. Alalu bent his knee; to the ground he fell on his chest.Alalu in combat was defeated; by acclaim Anu was hailed as kingAnu to the palace was escorted; Altalu to the palace did not return.26
