It was after that that Enki to Ninmah was speaking: Come be with me in the Abzu! In the midst of the Abzu, in a place of pure waters, an abode have I established. With a bright metal, silver is its name, it is embellished,With a deep blue stone, lapis lazuli, it is adorned;Come Ninmah, be with me, your adoration of Enlil abandon!To the Abzu, to the abode of Enki, Ninmah then journeyed;Enki there to her words of loving spoke,Of how for each other intended, sweet words to her he whispered. You are still my beloved! to her he said, caressing.He embraced her, he kissed her; she caused his phallus to water.Enki his semen into the womb of Ninmah poured. Give me a son! Give me a son! he cried out. She took the semen into her womb, the semen of Enki her impregnated.One day of Nibiru was a month of Earth for her,Two days, three days, four days of Nibiru like months of Earth they were,Five and six and seven and eight days of months were completed;The ninth count of motherhood was completed; Ninmah was in travail.To a child she gave birth; the newborn was a female;On the banks of the river in the Abzu a daughter to Enki and Ninrnah was born!Enki by a daughter was disappointed. Kiss the young one! to him Ninmah said.Kiss the young one! Enki to his vizier Isimud said: A son I desired,A son by my half sister I must have!Again he kissed Ninmah, by her loins he grabbed her. his semen into her womb he poured. Again she was with child, again a daughter to Enki she bore.A son, a son by you I must have! Enki to her cried out; Ninmah he kissed again.86
