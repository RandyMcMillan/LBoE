To the lifeless body of Inanna he took them, hanging from a stake she was.Upon the corpse the clay emissaries a Pulser and an Emitter directed,Then the Water of Life on her they sprinkled, in her mouth the Plant of Life they placed.Then Inanna stirred, her eyes she opened; from the dead Inanna arose.When the two emissaries Inanna to the Upper World were ready to return,Inanna the lifeless body of Dumuzi to take along them ordered.At the seven gates of the Lower Abzu, to Inanna her accoutrements and attributes were returned.To the abode of Dumuzi in the Black Land the lover of her youth to take the emissaries she ordered,There to wash him with pure water, with sweet oil him anoint,Then to clothe him in a red shroud, upon a slab of lapis lay him;Then in the rocks for him a rest place carve out, the Day of Arising there to await.As for herself, to the abode of Enki Inanna set her steps,Retribution for her beloved's death she wanted, the death of Marduk the culprit she demanded.There has been death enough! Enki to her said. Marduk an instigator was, but murder he committed not!When Inanna learned that Marduk would not by Enki be punished, Inanna to her parents and brother went.To high heaven she a wailing raised: justice! Revenge! Death to Marduk! she cried for. At Enlil's abode his sons Inanna and Utu joined, for a council of war they gathered. Ninurta, whom the rebel Anzu defeated, for strong measures argued;Of secret words between Marduk and the Igigi exchanged, Utu to them reported.Of Marduk, an evil serpent, Earth must be rid! Enlil with them agreed.When the demand for Marduk's surrender to Enki his father was sent,Enki to his abode Marduk and all the other sons summoned.Though for my beloved Dumuzi I am still grieving, Marduk's rights I must defend!194
