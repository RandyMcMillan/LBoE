To the tower and the whole encampment a complete end they made.To scatter abroad the leader and his followers Enlil thereupon decided,Henceforth their counsels to confuse, their unity to shatter, Enlil decreed:Until now all the Earthlings one language had, in a single tongue they speak.Henceforth their language I shall confound, that they each other's speech will not understand! In the three hundred and tenth year since the count of Earth years began did all this happen:In each region and every land the people a different tongue he made to speak,A different form of writing thereafter to each was given, that one the other will not comprehend. Twenty-three kings did in Kishi reign, for four hundred and eight years was it the Scepter City; It was also in Kishi that a beloved king, Etana, for a heavenly journey was taken.At the allotted time, let kingship to Unug-ki be transferred! So did Enlil decree.To its soil the Heavenly Bright Object from Kishi was transferred.When the decision to the people was announced, to Inanna an exaltation hymn they sang:Lady of the ME's, Queen, brightly resplendent,Righteous, in radiance clothed, of heaven and Earth beloved;By the love of Anu consecrated, great adorations wearing,Seven times the ME's she obtained, in her hand she them is holding.For the tiara of kingship they are appropriate, for high priesthood suitable,Lady of the great ME's, of them she is the guardian!In the four hundred and ninth year after the count of Earth years began,Kingship of the First Region to Unug-ki was transferred;Its first king was the high priest of the Eanna temple-abode, a son of Utu he was!As for Marduk, to the Land of the Two Narrows he went,To be the master of the Second Region, once established, he expected.213
