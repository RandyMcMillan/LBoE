One after another the gods fled their cities, their temples abandoned to the wind. In my city, Eridu, as the poisoned cloud approached, I could do nothing to stop it.Escape to the open steppe! to the people I gave instructions; with Ninki, my spouse, the city I abandoned.In his city Nippur, place of the Bond Heaven-Earth, Enlil could do nothing to stop it.The Evil Wind against Nippur was onrushing. In his celestial boat, Enlil and his spouse hurriedly took off.In Ur, Shumer's city of kingship, Nannar to his father Enlil for help cried;In the place of the temple that to heaven in seven steps rises, Nannar the hand of fate refused to heed.My father who begot me, great god who to Ur had granted kingship, turn the Evil Wind away! Nannar pleaded.Great god who decrees the fates, let Ur and its people be spared, your praises to continue! Nannar appealed.Enlil answered his son Nannar: Noble son, your wondrous city kingship was granted; eternal reign it was not granted.Take hold of your spouse Ningal, flee the city! Even I who decree fates, its destiny I cannot bend!Thus did Enlil my brother speak; alas, alas, not a destiny it was!A calamity none greater since the deluge gods and Earthlings has befallen; alas, not a destiny it was!The Great Deluge was destined to happen; the Great Calamity of the death-dealing storm was not.By the breach of a vow, by a council decision it was caused; by Weapons of Terror was it created.By a decision, not destiny, were the poisoned weapons unleashed; by deliberation was the lot cast.Against Marduk, my firstborn, did the two sons destruction direct; vengeance was in their hearts.Ascendancy is not Marduk's to grasp! Enlil's firstborn shouted. With weapons I shall oppose him, Ninurta said.Of people he raised an army, Babili as Earth's navel to declare! Nergal, Marduk's brother, so shouted.In the council of the great gods, words of venom were spread.12
