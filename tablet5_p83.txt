With him was Ninmah; her host of young ones by her side were assembledAlalgar who of Eridu was the master was there, Abgal who the Landing Place commanded also stood.In the Abzu were the heroes assembled, under the gaze of Enki thev stood;With Enki was his vizier Isimud; Nungal the pilot was there too.On Lahmu the heroes were assembled; with their proud commander Anzu they stood.Six hundred were on Earth, three hundred on Lahmu were gathered.In all there were nine hundred, the words of Anu the king they all heard:Heroes, of Nibiru you are the saviors! The fate of all is in your hands!Your success shall for eternity be recorded, by glorious names you shall be called.Those who on Earth are shall as Anunnaki be known, Those Who from Heaven to Earth Came! Those who on Lahmu are, Igigi shall be named, Those Who Observe and See they shall be! All that is required is ready: Let the gold start coming, let Nibiru be saved!Now this is the account of Enki and Enlil and Ninmah,Their loves and espousals, and by their sons the rivalries.Offspring of Anu the three leaders were, by different mothers were they born.Enki was the Firstborn son; a concubine of Anu was his mother.Enlil by Antu, the spouse of Anu, was born; the Legal Heir he thus became.Ninmah by another concubine was mothered, a half sister of the two half brothers she was. The Firstborn daughter of Anu she was, by her name-title Ninmah this was indicated.Greatly beautiful she was, full of wisdom, one quick to learn.Ea, as Enki then was named, by Anu to espouse Ninmah was chosen.Thereby their offspring son the legal successor thereafter to becomeNinmah of Enlil, a dashing commander, was enamored;By him she was seduced, into her womb his seed he poured,83
