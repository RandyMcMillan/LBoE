Damkina his spouse therein dwelt; to his son Marduk Enki was there wisdom teaching. In Nibru-ki Enlil the Bond Heaven-Earth established, a sight to see it was.At its center a heavenward tall pillar the sky itself was reaching,On a platform that cannot be overturned it was placed;Therewith the words of Enlil all settlements encompassed, on Lahmu and in Nibiru they were heard.From there beams were raised, the heart of all the lands they could search;Its eyes could scan all the lands, its net unwanted approach impossible made.In its lofty house a crown like chamber was the center, to distant heavens it peered;Toward the horizon was its gaze, the heavenly zenith it perfected.In its dark hallowed chamber, by twelve emblems was the family of the Sun marked,On ME's were the secret formulas of Sun and Moon, Nibiru and Earth, and eight celestial gods recorded.The Tablets of Destinies in the chamber their hues emitted,With them Enlil all comings and goings oversaw.On Earth the Anunnaki toiled, of work and sustenance they were complaining.By Earth's quick cycles they were disturbed, of the elixir they only small rations were given.In the Edin the Anunnaki toiled, in the Abzu the work was more backbreaking.By teams were Anunnaki sent back to Nibiru, by teams new ones were arriving.The Igigi, on Lahmu dwelling, were the loudest in complaining:When from Lahmu to Earth they descend, a rest place on Earth they were demanding.With Anu did Enlil and Enki words exchange, the king they consulted:Let the leader come to Earth, with Anzu have discussions! So did Anu to them say.Anzu to Earth from the heavens descended, the words of complaints to Enlil and Enki he delivered.Let Anzu of the workings gain understanding! Enki to Enlil was saying.88
