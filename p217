Over seven mountain ranges, through parched lands and then soaked by rains, the emissary to Aratta went,To the king of Aratta the demand words of Enmerkar word for word he repeated.His language the king of Aratta to understand was unable; like the bray of a donkey its sound was.A wooden scepter, inscribed with a message, the king of Aratta to the emissary gave. To share Unug-ki's ME's with Aratta the king's message requested,As a royal gift to Unug-ki grains on donkeys were loaded, with the emissary to Unug-ki they went.When Enmerkar the inscribed scepter received, its message in Unug-ki no one understood.He brought it forth from light to shade, he brought it forth from shade to light;What kind of wood is this? he asked. Then to plant it in the garden he ordered.After five years, after ten years had passed, from the scepter a tree grew, a tree of shade it was.What shall I do? Enmerkar in frustration his grandfather Utu asked.With heavenly Nisaba, the mistress of scribes and writing, Utu interceded.On a clay tablet his message to inscribe Nisaba Enmerkar taught, in the tongue of Aratta it was; By the hand of his son Banda was the message delivered: Submission or war! it said.By Inanna Aratta was not abandoned, to Unug-ki Aratta will not submit! the king of Aratta said. If warfare Unug-ki desires, let one warrior one warrior in combat meet!Better yet, let us peacefully treasures exchange; let Unug-ki its ME's for Aratta's riches give!On the way back, carrying the peace message, Banda fell sick; his spirit left him.His comrades raised his neck, without the breath of life it was;On Mount Hurum, on the way from Aratta, to his death was Banda abandoned,The riches of Aratta Unug-ki did not receive, the ME's of Unug-ki Aratta did not obtain;In the Third Region, Civilized Mankind did not fully blossom.217
