An everlasting plan have I designed! to her he was saying.That which for all time construction shall determine I have laid out;Away from Eridu, where dry land begins, my quarters shall be,Laarsa will be its name, a place for directing it shall become.On the banks of the Burannu, the River of Deep Waters, will it be located,A twin thereof a city shall in future arise, Lagash I shall name it.Between the two on the plans a line have I drawn,Sixty leagues thereafter a healing city shall come into being,A city of your own it shall be, Shurubak, the Haven City, I shall name it.On the center line it shall be located, to the fourth city it shall be leading;Nibru-ki, Earth's Crossing Place, I will name it, a Bond Heaven-Earth in it I shall establish. The Tablets of Destinies it shall house, all missions it will control!With Eridu five cities there shall be counted, to eternity, they shall exist!On a crystal tablet Enlil to Ninmah the master plan was showing;On the tablet she saw more markings, of them of Enlil she inquired.Beyond the five cities, a Chariot Place I shall henceforth build,From Nibiru to Earth directly to arrive! Enlil to her was responding.Why by Anuâ€™s plans for Lahmu Enlil was bewildered Ninmah then understood.My brother, magnificent is your plan for the Five cities! to him Ninmah was saying.The creation of Shurubak, a city for healing, as my abode, for my own to be,Is a matter for which grateful I am;Beyond that plan, do not transgress your father, your brother too do not offend!You are wise as well as beautiful! Enlil to her said.In the Abzu Enki plans was also conceiving, where to build his house,81
