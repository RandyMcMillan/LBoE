Hem-Ta, the Dark Brown Land, it was henceforth called.Neteru, Guardian Watchers, the Anunnaki were there in the new language called.Marduk as Ra, the Bright One, was worshiped; Enki as Ptah, the Developer, was venerated.Ningishzidda as Tehuti, the Divine Measurer, was recalled;To erase his memory Ra on the Stone Lion his image with that of his son Asar replaced.To count by tens, not by sixty, Ra the people made; the year he also by tens divided,The watching of the Moon by the watching of the Sun he replaced.Whereas under the lordship of Tehuti the olden City of the North and City of the South were reestablished,Marduk/Ra the two lands, of the North and of the South, into one Crown City united.A king, an offspring of Neteru and Earthling, he there appointed; Mena was his name.Where the two lands meet and the great river divides, a Scepter City Ra established.Splendor to surpass Kishi in the First Region he gave it, Mena-Nefer, Mena's Beauty, it was called.To honor his elders Ra a holy city built, to honor Nibiru's king Annu he named it; Therein on a platform a temple-abode for his father Enki-Ptah he erected,Its head, within a high tower, like a sharp rocket skyward rose.In its shrine Ra the upper part of his Celestial Barge deposited, Ben-Ben it was called; It was the one in which from the Planet of Countless Years he had traveled.On the day of the New Year, the king as High Priest the ceremonies performed,On that day only alone the innermost Star Room he entered, before the Ben-Ben offerings he put.To benefit the Second Region, Ptah to Ra all manner of ME's gave.What do I know that you do not know? the father his son asked.Then all manner of knowledge, except that of the dead reviving, to Ra he gave.As a Great One of the Twelve Celestials, Ptah to Ra the constellation sign of the Ram allotted. The waterflow of Hapi, the land's great river, Ptah for Ra and his people regulated,215
