I will the Abzu to him show, you the Bond Heaven-Earth to him reveal!To the words of Enki, Enlil consented.Enki to Anzu the Abzu did show, the toil in the mines to him he presented; Enlil Anzu to Nibru-ki invited, to the hallowed dark chamber he let him enter; In the innermost sanctuary the Tablets of Destinies to Anzu he explained. What the Anunnaki in the five cities were doing to Anzu was shown;To the Igigi who at the Landing Place were arriving relief he promised.To discuss the complaints of the Igigi he to Nibru-ki then returned.A prince among the princes was Anzu, of royal seed his ancestry he counted;Evil thoughts filled his heart when to the Bond Heaven-Earth he returned.To take away the Tablets of Destinies was he scheming,Of the decrees of heaven and Earth to take control in his heart he was planning.The removal of the Enlilship in his heart he conceived, to rule Igigi and Anunnaki was his aim!Unsuspecting Enlil at the entrance to the sanctuary Anzu let be stationed; Unsuspecting Enlil left the sanctuary, for a cooling swim he went away.With evil purpose Anzu the Tablets of Destinies seized;In a sky chamber he flew away, to the mountain of the sky chambers he swiftly went; There, in the Landing Place, rebellious Igigi for him were waiting,To declare Anzu king of Earth and Lahmu they were preparing!In the sanctuary of Nibru-ki the brilliance petered out, the humming quieted down,Silence in the place prevailed, suspended were the sacred formulas.In Nibru-ki Enlil was speechless; by the treachery he was overwhelmed.To Enki angry words he spoke, of the ancestry of Anzu he him questioned.In Nibru-ki the leaders gathered, the Anunnaki who decree fates with Anu were consulting.89
