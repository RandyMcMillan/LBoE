Like the planet of old of which the Earth and the Moon were fashioned, let her be called, From her womb's life essences other birth-givers shall be molded,To a multitude of Primitive Workers she thereby life will be givingThus was Ninki saying; the others words of concurring uttered.Now this is the account of Adamu and Ti-Amat in the Edin,And how they Knowing of procreation were given and to the Abzu expelled.After Ti-Amat in the womb of Ninki was fashioned,In seven vessels of the clay of the Abzu made Ninmah ovals of the two-legged females placed. The life essence of Ti-Amat she extracted, bit by bit in the vessels she it inserted.In the vessels of the clay of the Abzu made, Ninmah the admixture. formed;Incantations as the procedure befits she was uttering.In the wombs of the birth-giving heroines the fertilized ovals were inserted;There was conception, at the allotted time birth-giving; were occurring,At the allotted time, seven female Earthlings were born.Their features were proper, good sounds they were uttering.Thus were seven female counterparts for the Primitive Workers created;Seven male and seven female did the four leaders create them.After the Earthlings were thus created,Let the males the females inseminate, let the Primitive Workers by themselves offspring beget! So was Enki to the others saying. .After the allotted time, offsprings other offspring; will beget. Plentiful will be the Primitive Workers' numbers, the toil of the Anunnaki they shall hear!Enki and Ninki, Ninmah and Ningishzidda were joyful, the fruit's elixir they were drinking.For the semen and seven cages they made, among the trees they placed them;Let them together grow up, malehoods and femalehoods attain,109
