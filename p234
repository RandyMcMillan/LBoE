From the Valley of No Pity, by the brilliances spawned, toward Shumer the death was carried.To Enlil and Enki Ninurta and Nergal the alarm sounded: Unstoppable the Evil Wind death to all delivers!The alarm Enlil and Enki to the gods of Shumer transmitted: Escape! Escape! to them all they cried out.Let the people disperse, let the people hide!From their cities the gods did flee, like frightened birds from their nests escaping they were.The people of the lands by the Evil Storm's hand were clutched; futile was the running.Stealthy was the death, like a ghost the fields and cities it attacked;The highest walls, the thickest walls, like floodwaters it passed,No door could shut it out, no bolt could turn it back.Those who behind locked doors hid inside their houses like flies were felled,Those who to the streets fled, in the streets were their corpses piled up.Cough and phlegm the chests filled, the mouths with spittle and foam filled up;As the Evil Wind the people unseen engulfed, their mouths were drenched with blood.Slowly over the lands the Evil Wind blew, from west to east over plains and mountains it traveled;Everything that lived, behind it was dead and dying, people and cattle, all alike perished. The waters were poisoned, in the fields all vegetation withered.From Eridu in the south to Sippar in the north did the Evil Wind the land overwhelm; Babili, where Marduk supremacy declared, by the Evil Wind was spared.Synopsis of the Fourteenth TabletBabili, Marduk's chosen center, survives the calamity Enki sees it as an omen of Marduk's inevitable supremacy Enlil ponders the past, Fate, and DestinyAccepts Marduk's supremacy, retreats to faraway lands234
