Indeed a wonder of wonders it is, a new breed of Earthling on Earth has emerged, A Civilized Man has the Earth itself brought forth,Farming and shepherding, crafts and toolmaking he can be taught!So was Enlil to Enki saying. Let us of the new breed to Anu word send!Of the new breed word to Anu on Nibiru was beamed.Let seeds that can be sown, let ewes that sheep become, to Earth be sent!So did Enki and Enlil to Anu the suggestion make.By Civilized Man let Anunnaki and Earthlings become satiated!Anu the words heard, by the words he was amazed:That by life essences one kind to another leads is not unheard of! to them words back he sent.That on Earth a Civilized Man from the Adamu so quickly appeared, that is unheard of!For sowing and husbanding, great numbers are needed; perchance the beings to proliferate are unable?While the savants on Nibiru the matter contemplated,In Eridu occurrences of import took place:Adapa in a mating Titi knew, into her womb he poured his semen.There was conception, there was birth-giving:To twins, two brothers, Titi gave birth!Word of the birth to Anu on Nibiru was beamed:The twosome for conception are compatible, proliferation by them can occur! Let seeds that are sown, ewes that sheep become, to Earth be delivered,Let on Earth farming and shepherding begin, let us all be satiated!So did Enki and Enlil to Anu on Nibiru say.Let Titi in Eridu remain, the newborns to suckle and nurture,Let Adapa the Earthling to Nibiru be brought! So did Anu his decision declare.130
