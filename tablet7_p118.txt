So Marduk to Enki was saying. To Earth return I wish! to his father he disclosed.Enlil to his olden plans betook himself, what cities and their tasks he planned he reconsidered.A Chariot Place in the Edin must be established! to the others he was saying.The olden designs of the layout on the crystal tablet to them he showed.The conveying from the Landing Place to the way station on Lahmu is no longer certain,To soar toward Nibiru from Earth we must be able! So was Enlil to them saying.For the count since the first splashdown, the count of eighty Shars It was.Now this is the account of the journey to the Moon by Enki and Marduk,And how Enki the three Ways of Heaven and the constellations determined.Let the Place of the Chariots near Bad-Tibira, the Metal City, be established,Therefrom, let the gold from Earth to Nibiru in the chariots directly be carried!So Ninurta, of Bad-Tibira the commander, to them words was saying.Enlil to the words of Ninurta, his son, gave heed; of his son's wisdom he was proud.To Anu the king Enlil the plan quickly conveyed, to him words he was saying:Let a Place of Celestial Chariots in the Edin be established,Near the place where the gold ores are smelted and refined let it be built.Let the pure gold in the chariots directly from Earth to Nibiru be carried,Directly to Earth from Nibiru let heroes and supplies be coming!Of great merit is the plan of my brother! Enki to their father Anu was saying.A great disadvantage in its core it is holding:The netpull of Earth is than Lahmu's much greater; to overcome it our powers shall be exhausted!Before there is rush to deciding, let us an alternative examine:Nearby the Earth a companion it has, the Moon it is!Smaller is its netpull, ascent and descent thereon little effort will require.118
