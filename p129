Ninki to the foundlings a liking took, as her own children she raised then.Adapa, the Foundling, the boy she called; Titi, One with Life, the girl she named.Unlike all other Earthling children the twosome were:Slower to grow up than Earthlings they were, much quicker in understanding they were; With intelligence they were endowed, of speaking with words capable they were.Beautiful and pleasant was the girl, with her hands she was greatly dexterous;Ninki, the spouse of Enki, to Titi took a liking; all manner of crafts she was her teaching.To Adapa Enki himself teachings gave, how to keep records he was him instructing.The achievements with pride Enki to Isimud was showing,A Civilized Man have I brought forth! to lsimud he was saying.A new kind of Earthling from my seed has been created, in my image and after my likeness! From seed they food will grow, from ewes sheep they will shepherd,Anunnaki and Earthlings henceforth shall be satiated!To his brother Enlil Enki word sent; from Nibru-ki to Eridu Enlil came.In the wilderness a new kind of Earthling has come forth! to Enlil was Enki saying.Quick of learning they are, knowledge and craftwork to them can be taught.Let us from Nibiru seeds that are sown bring down,Let us from Nibiru ewes that sheep become to Earth deliver,Let us the new breed of Earthlings farming and shepherding teach,Let Anunnaki and Earthlings together satiated be! So was Enki to Enlil saying.Akin to us Anunnaki in many ways, indeed they are! Enlil to his brother said.A wonder of wonders it is, in the wilderness by themselves to have come about!Isimud was summoned. Among the bulrushes in reed baskets I them found! he said.Enlil the matter with graveness pondered, with amazement his head he shook.129
