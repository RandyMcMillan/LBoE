There were tears in the eyes of Alalu, there was amazement in the heart of Anu.Your wish shall be honored, to Anzu Anu said. Hereby let a promise by me to you be made,By my raised hand to you I this swear:On the next journey a chariot by Lahmu shall circuit, its skyship to you shall descend.If alive it shall find you, the master of Lahmu you shall be proclaimed;When a way station on Lahmu shall be established, its commander you shall be!Anzu bowed his head. So be it! to Anu he said.Into the sky chamber Alalu and Anzu were ushered,With Eagles' helmets and Fishes' suits they were provided, with food and tools they were supplied.From the circling chariot the skyship departed, from the chariot its descent was observed. Then from view it disappeared, and the chariot to Nibiru continued.For nine Shars was Alalu king on Nibiru, for eight Shars Eridu he commanded.In the ninth Shar, to die in exile on Lahmu was his fate.Now this is the account of the return of Anu to Nibiru,And how Alalu on Lahmu was buried, how Enlil on Earth the Landing Place built.On Nibiru there was for Anu a joyous welcome.Of what had happened to the council and the princes Anu gave account;Neither pity nor vengeance from them all he sought.To discuss the tasks ahead he them all instructed.To the assembled a vision great in scope he outlined:Way stations from Nibiru to Earth to establish, all the Sun's family in one kingdom to encompass!The first on Lahmu to be fashioned, the Moon for the plans also to be considered; On the other planets or their circling hosts stations to set up,A chain a constant caravan of chariots to supply and safeguard,74
