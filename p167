Let him in it save himself and his kinfolk,And the seed of all that is useful, be it plant or animal, also take;That is the will of the Creator of All!And Galzu, in the dream-vision, with the stylus on the tablet an image drew,And placed the engraved tablet by the side of Enki's bed;And after that the image faded, the dream-vision ended, and Enki with a shudder awoke.In his bed Enki for a while lying remained, with wonder the dream-vision he pondered:What was thereof the meaning, what omen did it hold?Then, as off his bed he stepped, to and behold there was the tablet;What in a mere dream-vision he had seen now by his bedside materially was!With trembling hands the lord Enki the tablet picked up,A design of a curious-shaped boat upon the tablet he saw,By the tablet's edge measuring markings there were, the boat's measures indicating!Astir with awe and hope the lord Enki by sunrise for his emissaries quickly sent,Find the one called Galzu, to him I must speak! So to them he said.By sundown all came back, to Enki thus reporting: None Galzu to find was able,Galzu, they said, to Nibiru did long ago return!Greatly baffled Enki was, the mystery and its omen to understand he strove.Unravel the mystery he could not, yet the message to him was clear!That night to the reed but where Ziusudra was sleeping Enki stealthily went;The oath not breaking, the lord Enki not to Ziusudra but to the hut's wall spoke:Wake up! Wake up! to the reed wall Enki was saying, from behind the reed screen he was speaking.When Ziusudra by the words was awakened, to him Enki from behind the reed screen said: Reed hut, reed hut! To my words pay attention, to my instructions heed pay!167
