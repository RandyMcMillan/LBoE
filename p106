So was Enki saying; by his decree Ninmah was greatly pleased.Whose wombs henceforth the fertilized ovals shall carry? Nigishzidda was asking.The leaders the matter pondered; Ninmah a solution offered.From her city Shurubak Ninmah female healers summoned, the task required to them she explained,To the crib of Adamu she led them, the newborn Earthling to perceive.To perform the task is not a commandment! Ninmah to them was saying; your own wish is the decision!Of the female Anunnaki assembled, seven stepped forward, seven the task accepted.Let their names for all time be remembered! Ninmah to Enki was saying.Their task is heroic, by them a race of Primitive Workers shall come into being!The seven stepped forward, each one her name was announcing; the names Ningishzidda recorded:Ninimma, Shuzianna, Ninmada, Ninbara, Ninmug, Musardu, and Ningunna,These were the names of the seven who by their own wish birth mothers were to be,Earthlings in their wombs to conceive and bear, Primitive Workers to create.In seven vessels of the clay of the Abzu made, Ninmah ovals of the two-legged females placed,The life essence of Adamu she extracted, bit by bit in the vessels she it inserted.Then in the malepart of Adamu an incision she made, a drop of blood to let out;Let this a Sign of Life be; that Flesh and Soul have combined let it forever proclaim!She squeezed the malepart for blood, one drop of blood in each vessel to the admixture she added.In this clay's admixture, Earthling with the Anunnaki shall be bound!Thus was Ninmah saying, an incantation she was pronouncing:To a unity shall the two essences, one of Heaven, one of Earth, together be brought, That which is of Earth and that which is from Nibiru by a blood kinship shall be bonded! So was Ninmah pronouncing; her words Ningishzidda also recorded.106
