There was Winter and there was Summer; by Year of Earth did Ea the full circuit call.By Year's end of the accumulated gold account was taken;Much to dispatch to Nibiru there was not.The swamplands' waters are deficient, let the chariot to the deeper ocean be moved! So was Ea saying.From its moorings was the chariot untied, back whence it came it was shifted.With great care were the crystal vessels stirred up, the saltwaters through them passing.Metals by their kinds were separated; gold among them was sparkling!From the chariot of the happenings Ea to Nibiru word did bean; Anu to hear it was pleased indeed.In its destined circuit Nibiru to the Sun's abode was returning, A closeness to Earth on its Shar circuit was Nibiru attaining.With eagerness did Anu about the gold inquire. Is there enough for sending to Nibiru he was asking.Alas, not enough was of the gold from the waters collected;Let another Shar pass, let the quantity be doubled! Ea to Anu counseled.Fron the ocean's waters the obtaining of gold continued;In his heart Ea with apprehension was filling.From the chariot parts were hauled out, a sky chamber from them was assembled.Abgal, he who knows piloting, of the sky chamber to take charge he appointed;Daily in the sky chamber with Abgal did Ea upward soar, the Earth and its secrets to learn.For the sky chamber an enclosure was constructed, by Alalu's chariot was it placed:Daily the crystals in Alalu's chariot did Ea study, what by their beams was discovered to understand;Whence does the gold come? he asked Alalu. Where on Earth are Tiamat's golden veins? In the sky chamber with Abgal did Ea upward soar, the Earth and its secrets to learn. Over great mountains they roamed, in the valleys great rivers they saw;Steppes and forests below were stretched, thousands of leagues was their reach.59
