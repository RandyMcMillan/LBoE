They the cave's entrance again with stones covered;The image of Alalu upon the great rock mountain with beams they carved.They showed him wearing an Eagle's helmet; his face they made uncovered.Let the image of Alalu forever gaze toward Nibiru that he ruled,Toward the Earth whose gold he discovered!So Ninmah, Exalted Lady, in the name of her father Anu did declare.As for you, Anzu, to you Anu the king his promise shall be keeping!Twenty heroes with you here shall remain, the way station's building to begin;Rocketships from Earth the golden ores shall here deliver,Celestial chariots from here the gold to Nibiru shall then transport.Hundreds of heroes their abode on Lahmu shall make,You, Anzu, shall be their commander!Thus did the Great Lady, in the name of her father Anu, to Anzu say.My life I owe to you, Great Lady! So was Anzu saying. My gratitude to Anu shall limits not have!
