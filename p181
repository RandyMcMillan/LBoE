Then Enlil by his own hand the Nibiru crystals activated.Inside eerie lights began to flicker, an enchanting hum the stillness broke;Outside the capstone all at once was shining, brighter than the Sun it was.The multitude of assembled Anunnaki a great cry of joy uttered;Ninmah, by the occasion moved, a poem recited and sang:House that is like a mountain, house with a pointed peak,For Heaven-Earth it is equipped, the handiwork of the Anunnaki it is.House bright and dark, house of heaven and Earth,For the celestial boats it was put together, by the Anunnaki built.House whose interior with a reddish light of heaven glows,A pulsating beam that far and high reaches it emits;Lofty mountain of mountains, great and lofty fashioned,Beyond the understanding of Earthlings it is.House of equipment, lofty house of eternity,Its foundation stones the waters touch, its great circumference in clay is set.House whose parts are skilfully together woven,The great ones who in the skies circle to a resting make descent;House that for the rocketships is a landmark, with unfathomable insides,By Anu himself is the Ekur blessed.Thus did Ninmah at the celebration recite and sing.While the Anunnaki their remarkable handiwork were celebrating,Enki to Enlil words of suggestion said: When in future days it will be asked:When and by whom has this marvel been fashioned?Let us beside the twin peaks a monument create, the Age of the Lion let it announce,181
