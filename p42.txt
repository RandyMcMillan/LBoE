Another breath he took, then another and another; the air of Ki indeed compatible was! Alalu clapped his hands, a song of joy he was singing.Without an Eagle's helmet, without a Fish's suit, to the ground himself he lowered.The brightness outside was blinding; the rays of the Sun were overpowering!Into the chariot he returned, a mask for the eyes he donned.He picked up the carried weapon, he picked up the handy Sampler.To the ground himself lie lowered, on the dark-hued soil he stepped.He made his way toward the marshes; dark greenish were the waters.By the marsh's edge there were pebbles; Alalu picked a pebble, into the marsh he thrust it. In the marsh a moving his eyes glimpsed: The waters with fishes were filled!Into the marsh the Sampler he lowered, the murky waters to consider;For drinking the water was not fit, Alalu greatly disappointing.He turned away from the marshes, in the direction of the hills he want.He made his way through vegetation; bushes to trees gave way.The place was like an orchard, the trees with fruits were laden.By their sweet smell enticed, Alalu picked a fruit; in his mouth he put it.Sweet was the smell, sweeter the taste was! Alalu greatly it delighted.Away, from the Sun's rays Alalu was walking, toward the hills he set his direction.Among the trees a wetness under his feet he sensed, a sign of closeby waters.In the direction of the wetness he set his course;In the midst of the forest there was a pond, a pool of silent waters.Into the pond the Sampler he lowered; for drinking the water was good!Alalu laughed; an unstopping laughter seized him.The air was good, the water for drinking was fit; there was fruit, there were fishes!42
