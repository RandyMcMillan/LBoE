Twenty-four years in the midst of Harran I nested, an omen in its temple I sought; Until when? about my lordship an omen in the temple I asked.Your days of exile are completed! to me the oracle in the temple said.Oh great gods who the fates determine, let me to my city set my course,My temple Esagil as an everlasting abode establish, a king in Babili install;In my temple house let all the Anunnaki gods assemble, my covenant accept!So did Marduk, confessing and appealing, to the other gods his coming announce.By his appeal for their submission the Anunnaki gods were disturbed and alarmed.To a great assembly, counsel to take, Enlil them all summoned.All the Anunnaki leaders in Nibru-ki gathered; Enki and Marduk's brothers also came.About the happenings all of them were agitated, opposed to Marduk and Nabu they all were.In the council of the great gods, accusations were rampant, recriminations filled the chamber.What is coming no one can prevent; let us Marduk's supremacy accept! Enki alone counseled.If the time of the Ram is coming, let us Marduk of the Bond Heaven-Earth deprive! Enlil in anger proposed.To obliterate the Place of the Celestial Chariots all except Enki agreed;To use therefore the Weapons of Terror Nergal suggested; only Enki was opposed:Of the decision, Earth to Anu the words pronounced; Anu to Earth the words repeated.What was destined to be, by your decision to undo will fail! So did Enki say as he departed. The evil thing to carry out Ninurta and Nergal were selected.Now this is the account of how Fate to Destiny did lead,How step by step, some in long forgotten times taken, the Great Calamity made happen! Now let it for all time be recorded and remembered:When the decision to use the Weapons of Terror was made, to himself Enlil two secrets kept:To no one, before the terrible decision was taken, did Enlil the secret of Galzu's dream-vision reveal;230
