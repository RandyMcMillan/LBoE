When to Earth they all returned, the two brothers the two sisters espoused,Asar the one called Asta chose, Satu the one called Nebat betrothed.Asar with his father Marduk in the dark-hued lands to abide chose,Satu near the Landing Place, where the Igigi dwelt, with Shamgaz his dwelling made.About the domains on Earth was Shamgaz concerned: Where shall the Igigi the masters be? So did Shamgaz the other Igigi incite, of that Nebat to Satu daily spoke;By staying with his father, Asar the successor alone shall be, the fertile lands he will inherit! So did Shamgaz and his daughter Nebat to Satu day after day say.How the succession in the hands of Satu alone to retain, father and daughter schemed.On an auspicious day they made a banquet; Igigi and Anunnaki to it they invited.Asar, unsuspecting, to celebrate with his brother also came.Nebat, his spouse's sister, prepared the tables, footstools she also set,She beautified herself, with lyre in hand a song to mighty Asar she sang.Satu before him choice roast meat cut, with salted knife for him fatlings he served.Shamgaz in a large goblet new wine to Asar offered, an admixture for him he made,A large vessel, mighty to look upon, with elixired wine he gave him.In good humor was Asar; merrily he arose and sang, with cymbals in his hand he chanted.Then by the admixtured wine he was overcome, to the ground he fell down.Let us for a sound sleep take him! the hosts to the others at the banquet said.They Asar to another chamber carried, in a coffin they him laid,The coffin with tight seals they closed, into the sea they threw it.When word of what had happened Asta reached, to Marduk her husband's father she raised a wailing:Asar to his death in the sea depths was brutally thrown, quickly must the coffin be found! They searched the sea for Asar's coffin, by the shores of the dark-hued land it was found.185
