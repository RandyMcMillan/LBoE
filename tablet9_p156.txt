To Lu-Mach from Shurubak word was sent: To the Edin return, a son you have! To the Edin, to Shurubak, Lu-Mach returned, to him Batanash the son showed. White as the snow his skin was, the color of wool was his hair,Like the skies were his eyes, in a brilliance were his eyes shining.Amazed and frightened was Lu-Mach; to his father Matushal he hurried.A son unlike an Earthling to Batanash was born, by this birth greatly puzzled I am!Matushal to Batanash came, the newborn boy he saw, by his likeness amazed he was.Is one of the Igigi the boy's father? Of Batanash Matushal the truth demanded;To Lu-Mach your spouse whether this boy his son is, the truth reveal!None of the Igigi is the boy's father, of this upon my life I swear! So did Batanash him answer To his son Lu-Mach Matushal then turned, a calming arm on his shoulders he putA mystery the boy is, but in his oddness an omen to you is revealed,Unique he is, for a task unique by destiny he was chosen.What that task is, I know not; in time appropriate, known it shall become!So was Matushal to his son Lu-Mach saying; to what on Earth was transpiring, he was alluding: In those days the sufferings on Earth were increasing,The days colder grew, the skies their rains were holding back,Fields their crops diminished, in the sheepfolds ewe lambs were few.Let the son to you born, unusual as he is, an omen be that a respite is coming!So did Matushal to his son Lu-Mach say. Let Respite be his name!To Matushal and Lu-Mach Batanash her son's secret did not reveal;Ziusudra, He of Long Bright Lifedays, she called him; in Shurubak he was raised.Ninmah on the child her protection and affection bestowed.Of much understanding he was endowed, with knowledge he was by her provided.156
