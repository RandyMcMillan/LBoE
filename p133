A bread on Earth not found they to you will give; the bread is death, do not eat! In a chalice an elixir to drink they to you will give; the elixir is death, do not drink!With you Ningishzidda and Dumuzi my sons will journey, to their words hearken, and you shall live!So did Enki Adapa instruct. This I shall remember! Adapa said.Enki Ningishzidda and Dumuzi summoned, to them a blessing and advice he gave.Before Anu the king, my father, you are coming, to him you shall bow and homage pay;By princes and nobles do not be cowered, of them you are the equals.To bring Adapa back to Earth is your mission, by Nibiru's delights be not charmed!This we shall remember! Ningishzidda and Dumuzi said.His young one, Dumuzi, Enki embraced, on the forehead he kissed him;The wise one Ningishzidda Enki embraced, on the forehead he kissed him.A sealed tablet in the hand of Ningishzidda unseen he placed,To my father Anu this tablet in secret you shall give! So did Enki to Ningishzidda say.Then the two with Adapa to Sippar departed, to the Place of the Celestial Chariots they went,To Ilabrat, Anu's vizier, the three of them themselves presented.To Ningishzidda and Dumuzi the garb of Igigi was given, like celestial eagles they were dressed.As for Adapa, his unkept hair was shaven, a helmet as that of an Eagle he was given,Instead of his loincloth a tight-fitting vestment he was made to wear,Between Ningishzidda and Dumuzi, inside That Which Ascends he was placed.When the signal was given, the Celestial Chariot roared and shuddered;In fright did Adapa cower and cry out: The Eagle without wings is soaring!Upon his sides Ningishzidda and Dumuzi their arms placed, with soothing words they him calmed.When one league aloft they were borne, upon the Earth they glanced Out; its lands they saw, by seas and oceans into parts separated.When two leagues aloft they were, the ocean to a tub grew smaller. the land was the size of a basket.133
