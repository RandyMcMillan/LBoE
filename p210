Therein, in consecrated soil, Anu and Enlil the Heavenly Bright Object implanted.In it Ninurta the first king appointed, Mighty Man was his royal title.To make it a center for Civilized Mankind, Ninurta to Eridu journeyed,The ME tablets that for kingship divine formulas hold from Enki to obtain.Properly attired, with respect Ninurta Eridu entered, for the ME of kingship he asked: Enki, the lord who all the ME's safeguards, fifty ME to Ninurta granted.In Kishi were the black headed people with numbers to calculate taught,Heavenly Nisaba writing them taught, heavenly Ninkashi beermaking them showed.In Kishi, by Ninurta guided, kilnwork and smithing proliferated,Wheeled wagons, to male asses harnessed, craftily in Kishi first were fashioned.Laws of justice and righteous behavior in Kishi were promulgated.It was in Kishi that the people hymns of praise to Ninurta composed:Of his heroic deeds and victories they sang, of his awe-inspiring Black Bird they chanted,How in faraway lands the bisons he subdued, how the white metal to mix with copper he found. Ninurta's glorious time it was, with the Constellation of the Archer he was honored.All the while Inanna in Unug-ki her lordship in the Third Region awaited,All the while the domain of her own of the leaders she demanded.The Third Region after the second one will come! her leaders thus assured her.Having seen how Ninurta to Eridu journeyed, how the ME of kingship he obtained,Inanna in her heart a plan devised, to obtain ME from Enki she schemed.Her chambermaid Ninshubur to Eridu she dispatched, a visit by Inanna to announce.On this hearing Enki to Isimud, his housemaster, quickly instructions gave:The maiden, all alone, to my city Eridu her step is directing,When all alone she will arrive, my inner chambers let her enter.210
