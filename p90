Anzu must be seized, the Tablets to the sanctuary, must be returned! Thus did Anu decree. Who shall the rebel face? Who shall the Tablets retrieve? the leaders asked each other.With the Tablets of Destinies in his possession, invincible is Anzu! to each other they were saying.Ninurta, by his mother encouraged, from the assembled stepped forward:Enlil's warrior I shall be, Anzu I shall vanquish! Thus was Ninurta saying.To the mountainside Ninurta set his course, to vanquish the fugitive Anzu he undertook.Anzu from his hideout Ninurta was mocking: The Tablets are my protection, invincible I am!Lightning darts Ninurta at Anzu directed; the arrows could not approach Anzu, backward they turned.The battle was stilled, Ninurta's weapons Anzu did not vanquish!Enki then to Ninurta counsel gave: With your Whirlwind stir up a storm,Let the dust cover Anzu's face, let it the wings of his skybird ruffle!For his son Enlil a mighty weapon fashioned, a Tillu missile it was;To your Stormer-weapon attach it, when wing to wing near, at Anzu shoot it!Thus did Enlil his son Ninurta instruct.When wing to wing near each other, let the missile fly as a lightning!Again Ninurta in his Whirlwind soared; Anzu against him in his skybird rose to challenge. Wing to wing! Anzu in anger shouted. This battle will be your destruction!Ninurta the advice of Enki followed; with his Whirlwind a dust storm he created.The dust Anzu's face covered, the pinions of his skybird were exposed;Into their midst Ninurta the missile let loose, a fiery brilliance Anzu's pinions engulfed. Like butterflies his wings began to flutter; to the ground Anzu came falling.The Earth shook, the skies became darkened;The fallen Anzu Ninurta made captive, from him the Tablets he retrieved.From the Mountaintop the Igigi were watching;90
