Before Enkime for the heavens departed, all that in the heavens he was taught. In writings Enkime a record made, for his sons to know he wrote it;All that is in the heavens in the family of the Sun he wrote down,And about the quarters of the Earth and its lands and its rivers tooTo the hands of Matushal, his firstborn son, the writings he entrusted, With his brothers Ragim and Gaidad to study and abide by.In the one hundred and fourth Shar was Matushal born,To the Igigi troubles and what Marduk had done he was a witness.By his spouse Ednat a son to Matushal was born, Lu-Mach, Mighty Man, was his name.In his days conditions on Earth became harsher; the toilers in field and meadow raised complaints.As a workmaster the Anunnaki Lu-Mach appointed, the quotas to enforce, the rations to reduce. In his days it was that Adapa his deathtime attained;And when Adapa knew that his days to an end were coming,Let all my sons and sons of sons assemble themselves to me! he said,That before I die I may bless them, and words to them speak before I die.And when Sati and the sons of the sons had gathered,Where is Ka-in, my firstborn? Adapa of them all asked. Let him be fetched! to them all he said.Before the lord Enki Sati his father's wish presented, what to be done of the lord he asked.Enki then Ninurta summoned: Let the banished one, of whom the mentor you were, to Adapa's deathbed be brought!In his Bird of Heaven Ninurta betook himself, to the Land of Wandering he flew;Over the lands he roamed, from the skies for Ka-in he searched.And when he him found, like on Eagle's wings Ka-in to Adapa he brought.When of his son's arrival Adapa was informed, Let Ka-in and Sati before me come! Adapa said. Before their father the two came, Ka-in the firstborn on the right, Sati on the left.146
