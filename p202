In its center, upon a raised platform, an abode for Enki and Ninki was built,House of tile Lord Whose Return Is trimphant it was called;With gold and silver and precious metals by Enki's sons provided it was adorned.Above in a circle skyward pointing, the twelve constellations by their signs were marked out.
