Enki the child greatly adored, to read the writings of Adapa him he taught,The priestly rites how to observe and perform the boy as a young man learned.In the one hundred and tenth Shar was Ziusudra born,In Shurubak he grew up and espoused Emzara, and she bore him three sons.In his days the sufferings on Earth intensified; plagues and starvations the Earth afflicted.Now this is the account of Earth's tribulations before the Deluge,And how the mysterious Galzu decisions of life and death in secret guided.By the conjugations of Igigi and the Earthling daughters was Enlil greatly disturbed,By Marduk's espousal of an Earthling female Enlil was much distraught.In his eyes the Anunnaki mission to Earth had become perverted,To him the howling, shouting Earthling masses an anathema became;Oppressive the pronouncements of the Earthlings have become,The conjugations of sleep deprive me! So did Enlil to the other leaders say.In the days of Ziusudra plagues and pestilences the Earth afflicted,Aches, dizziness, chills, fevers the Earthlings overwhelmed.Let us the Earthlings curing teach, how themselves to remedy to learn! So did Ninmah say.This by decree I forbid! Enlil to her pleas retorted.In the lands whereto the Earthlings have spread, waters from their sources did not rise,The earth shut its womb, vegetation did not sprout.Let us the Earthlings pond- and canal-building teach, let them from the seas fish and sustenance obtain!So did Enki to the other leaders say.This by decree I forbid! Enlil to Enki said. Let the Earthlings by hunger and pestilence perish! For one Shar the Earthlings ate the grasses of the fields,For the second Shar, the third Shar, the vengeance of Enlil they suffered.157
