Inanna by her parents Nannar and Ningal was beloved, Enlil by her cradle sat.Beautiful beyond describing she was, in martial arts with Anunnanki heroes she competed.Of journeys in the heavens and of celestial boats from her brother Utu she learned;A skyship of her own, to roam in Earth's skies, to her the Anunnaki presented.After the Deluge, on the Landing Platform, Dumuzi and Inanna their eyes on each other set;At the dedication of the artificed mounts was between them a warm encounter.Hesitant at first they were, he of Enki's clan, she of Enlil an offspring.When Ninharsag for peace the disputing clans together brought,Inanna and Dumuzi away from the others to be together managed, love to each other they professed.As they went strolling together, sweet words of alluring love to each other they said. Side by side they lay down, one heart with the other heart chatted;Around her waist Dumuzi put his arm, like a wild bull to take her he wished,Let me teach you! Let me teach you! to Inanna Dumuzi said.Gently she kissed him, then to him of her mother she spoke:What fib could I tell my mother? What words will you tell Ningal?Let us of our love my mother tell, of joy cedar perfume she will on us sprinkle!To the dwelling place of Ningal, Inanna's mother, the lovers went,To them Ningal her blessing gave, of Dumuzi the mother of Inanna approved.Lord Dumuzi, as a son-in-law of Nannar you are worthy! to him she said.Dumuzi as bridegroom by Nannar himself was welcomed, Inanna's brother Utu, Let it so be! said.Perchance the espousing peace between the clans truly will bring! Enlil to them all said. When of the love and bethrothal Dumuzi to his father and brothers spoke,Enki of peace through espousal also was thinking, his blessing to Dumuzi he gave. Dumuzi's brothers, all except Marduk, about the espousal were joyful.190
