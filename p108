By the task Ninki was fascinated. Let it be done! she to them said.By the ME formulas Ningishzidda adjusting made, by the admixture was an oval fertilized, Into the womb of his spouse Enki it inserted; with much care he did it.There was conception; in the allotted time Ninki was in travail; a birth there was not.Ninki the months counted, Ninmah the months counted;The tenth month, a month of evil fates, they began to call.Ninmah, the lady whose hand wombs has opened, with a cutter an incision made.Her head was covered, on her hands protections she wore;With dexterity the opening she made, her face at once was brightened:That which in the womb was from the womb came forth.A female! A female birth was given! to Ninki with joy she shouted.The newborn's visage and limbs they carefully examined,Of good shape were her ears, her eyes were not clogged;Her limbs were proper, hindparts like legs, foreparts like hands were shaped;Shaggy she was not, like beach sands was the hue of her head hair,Her skin smooth was, as that of the Anunnaki in smoothness and color it was.Ninmah the girl child held in her hands. She slapped her hindparts;Proper sounds the newborn uttered!To Ninki, the spouse of Enki, she the newborn handed, to be suckled, nourished, and raised. A name will you give her? Enki of his spouse inquired. A Being she is, not a creature.In your image she is and after your likeness,Perfectly she is fashioned, a model for female workers you have attained!Ninki cast her hand upon the newborn's body, with her fingers her skin she caressed. Ti-Amat let her name be, the Mother of Life! Ninki was saying.108
