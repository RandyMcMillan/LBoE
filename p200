Of the Landing Place in the Cedar Mountains, lordship to Ishkur was granted,To his domain northward thereof was the Landing Place joined.The lands south and east thereof, where the Igigi and their offspring had spread,To Nannar as an everlasting endowment were given, by his descendants and followers to keep and to hold.The peninsula wherein the Place of the Chariots was, in Nannar's lands was included,Utu as commander of the Place and of the Navel of the Earth was confirmed.In the Land of the Two Narrows, as agreed, Enki to Ningishzidda the lordship did assign.To that none of Enki's other sons objected; to that Inanna was opposed!To the heritage of Dumuzi, her deceased bridegroom, did Inanna claim lay,A dominion of her own she of Enki and Enlil demanded.How Inanna's demands to satisfy the leaders contemplated,About the, lands and the peoples the Great Anunnaki who the fates decree counsel took,Regarding the Earth and its resettling words with Anu they exchanged.From the time of the Deluge, the Great Calamity, almost two Shars have passed,The Earthlings have proliferated, from mountainlands to dried lowlands they went.Of Civilized Mankind by Ziusudra there were descendants, with Anunnaki seed they were intermixed.Offspring of Igigi who intermarried roamed about, in the distant lands Ka-in's kinfolk survived.Few and lofty were the Anunnaki who from Nibiru had come, few were their perfect descendants.How settlements for themselves and for Earthlings to establish the Great Anunnaki considered, How over Mankind lofty to remain, how to make the many the few obey and serve.About all that, about the future the leaders with Anu words exchanged.To come to Earth one more time Anu decided; with Antu his spouse he wished to come.200
