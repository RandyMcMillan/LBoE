When to the Landing Place Ninurta came, they trembled and kissed his feet.Ninurta the captive Abgal and Anunnaki set free, to Anu and Enlil his victory he announced.To Nibru-ki he then returned, in its innermost chamber the Tablets were reinstalled.Once again the brilliance therein returned, the hum of ME's in the Tablets was restored.Before the Seven Who judge Anzu for a judgment was taken;Enlil and Ninlil his spouse, Enki and his spouse Ninki, the one beforehand as Damkina known,And the sons Nannar and Marduk were there; Ninmah also was in judging.Ninurta of the evil deeds spoke: There was no justification, let death be the penalty! he said.The Igigi by right were complaining, a rest place on Earth they do need! Marduk in counter argued.By his evil deed all the Anunnaki and Igigi Anzu did endanger! Enlil said.Enki and Ninmah with Enlil agreed; the evil must be extinguished! they said.To death by execution the seven judged Anzu;With a killing ray Anzu's life breath was extinguished. Let his body to the vultures be left! Ninurta said.Let him on Lahmu be buried, in a cave next to Alalu be laid to rest! Enki was saying. From the same ancestral seed the two of them were!Let Marduk the body to Lahmu carry, let Marduk there as commander stay!So was Enki to the judges suggesting. Let it so be! Enlil said.Now this is the account of how Bad-Tibira, the Metal City, was established, And how in the fortieth Shar the Anunnaki in the Abzu mutinied.In the twenty-fifth Shar was Anzu judged and executed,The unrest of the Igigi it subdued but left it simmering.To Lahmu Marduk was sent, the spirits of the Igigi to raise, to their well-being pay attention.On Earth changes were by Enlil and Enki discussed, to avoid unrest on Earth they were considering.91
