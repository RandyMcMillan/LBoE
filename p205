The will of the Creator of All is clear to see: On Earth and for Earthlings, only emissaries we are The Earth to the Earthlings belongs, to preserve and advance them we were intended!If that is our mission here, let us accordingly act! So did Enki say.The great Anunnaki who the fates decree counsels exchanged regarding the lands:To create civilized regions the Great Anunnaki decided, therein knowledge to Mankind provide; Cities of Man to establish, therein in sacred precincts abodes for the Anunnaki create; Kingship as on Nibiru on Earth establish, crown and scepter to a chosen man give;By him the word of the Anunnaki to the people convey, work and dexterity to enforce;In the sacred precincts a priesthood to establish, the Anunnaki as lofty lords to serve and worship.Secret knowledge to be taught, civilization to Mankind convey.To create four regions, three for Mankind, one restricted, the Anunnaki resolved:The first region in the olden Edin-land to establish, for Enlil and his sons to dominate;The second region in the Land of the Two Narrows thereafter to follow, for Enki and his sons to lord;The third region, with the other two not mingling, in a distant land to Inanna grant;The fourth region, for the Anunnaki alone consecrated, the peninsula of the Place of the Chariots will be.Now this is the account of Anu's journey to the lands beyond the oceans,And how in the First Region for,the Anunnaki cities were reestablished.Having the decision about the four regions and Mankind's civilizations made,Anu about his grandson Marduk inquired. I must see him again! to the leaders Anu said. Whether by Dumuzi and Ningishzidda to Nibiru inviting, Marduk's ire I myself have caused! So did Anu wonder; to reconsider the punishment of Marduk he wished.When to the lands beyond the oceans you journey, Marduk to meet you will be told! The land where he roams, in those parts of the Earth it is! So did Enlil to Anu say.205
