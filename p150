For it came to pass that soon thereafter Marduk to his father Enki came,A matter of gravity with his father Enki to discuss he wished.Upon the Earth the three sons of Enlil spouses have chosen:Ninurta Ba'u, of Anu a young daughter, has espoused; Nannar has chosen Ningal, Ishkur Shala has taken;By Nergal your son Ereshkigal, of Enlil a granddaughter, as a spouse was taken, By threats to kill her, her consent from her was extracted.To await my espousal, being your firstborn, Nergal did not await,The other four in deference my espousal are awaiting.A bride I wish to choose, to have a spouse it is my desire!So did Marduk to his father Enki say.Your words happy make me! Enki to Marduk was saying. Your mother too shall rejoice! To hold his words to Ninki, Marduk with a raised hand to his father motioned.Is she one of the young ones who heal and succor give? Enki went on to ask.A descendant of Adapa she is, of Earth, not Nibiru, is she! Marduk softly whispered. With a puzzled look, Enki was speechless; then uncontrolled words he shouted:A prince of Nibiru, a Firstborn to succession entitled, an Earthling will espouse?!Not an Earthling but your own offspring! to him Marduk said.A daughter of Enkime who to heaven was taken she is, Sarpanit is her name!Enki his spouse Ninki summoned, to her what with Marduk transpired he related.To Ninki, his mother, Marduk his heart's desire repeated and said:When Enkime with me was journeying, and of heaven and Earth him I was teaching, What my father once had said, I with my own eyes witnessed:Step by step on this planet a Primitive Being, one like us to be, we have created,In our image and in our likeness Civilized Earthling is, except for the long life, he is we!150
