So did Enki the secret of Adapa to his father Anu reveal.By the secret message from Enki Anu was astounded; whether to angry be or laugh he knew not.Ilabrat his vizier to his private chamber he summoned, to him he thus said:That son of mine Ea, even as Enki his free ways with females has not mended!To Ilabrat his vizier the message on the tablet he showed.What are the rules, what is the king to do? of his vizier Anu inquired.Concubines by our rules are permitted; of interplanetary cohabitation no rules exist!So did Ilabrat to the king respond. If damage there be, let it be restricted,Let Adapa forthwith to Earth be returned. Let Ningishzidda and Dumuzi longer stay!Anu then Ningishzidda to his private chamber summoned;Know you what your father's message said? of Ningishzidda he inquired.Ningishzidda his head lowered, with whispering voice he said:I know not, but guess I can. The life essence of Adapa I have tested, of Enki's seed he is!That indeed is the message! to him Anu said. Adapa to Earth forthwith shall return,To be of Civilized Man a progenitor his destiny shall be!As for you, Ningishzidda, to Earth with Adapa you shall returnOf Civilized Mankind at your father's side to become the teacher!So did Anu the king the decision make, the destiny of Adapa and Ningishzidda he determined. To the assembled savants and nobles, princes and counselors Anu and the other two returned, To the assembled words of decision Anu announced:The welcome to the Earthling must not be overextended, on our planet he cannot eat or drink; Of his astounding abilities we have all seen, let him to Earth return,Let his offspring there on Earth fields till and in meadows shepherd!To ensure his safety and avoid his agitation, Ningishzidda with him back will travel,136
