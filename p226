Babili, the Gateway of the Gods, Nabu in his father's honor named it,In the heart of the Edin, in the midst of the First Region, Marduk himself established!Inanna's fury no boundary knew; with her weapons on Marduk's followers death she inflicted.The blood of people, as never before on Earth, like rivers flowed.To his brother Marduk Nergal to Babili came, for the sake of the people Babili to leave him he persuaded:Let us peacefully wait for the true signs of heaven! Nergal to his brother said.To depart Marduk agreed, from land to land the skies to watch he traveled,Amun, the Unseen One, in the Second Region was Ra henceforth called.For a while was Inanna appeased, two sons of Sharru-kin his peaceful successors were.Then on the throne of Agade Sharru-kin's grandson ascended; Naram-Sin, by Sin Loved, he was called.In the First Region Enlil and Ninurta absent were, to the lands beyond the oceans they went; In the Second Region Ra was away, as Marduk in other lands he traveled;Her chance in her hands to seize all powers Inanna envisioned, Naram-Sin to seize all lands she commanded.To march against Magan and Meluhha, Marduk domains, Naram-Sin she instructed.The sacrilege of an Earthlings' army through the Fourth Region passing Naram-Sin committed,Magan he invaded, the sealed Ekur, House Which Like a Mountain Is, to enter he attempted.By the sacrileges and transgressions Enlil was infuriated; upon Naram-Sin and Agade a curse & put:By a bite of a scorpion did Naram-Sin die, by the command of Enlil was Agade wiped out. At the count of a thousand and five hundred Earth years did this happen.Now this is the account of the prophecy by Galzu to Enlil in a vision given;About Marduk's supremacy it was, how a calamity to survive a man to choose.After Marduk Amun became, kingship in the Second Region disintegrated, disorder and confusion reigned;After Agade was wiped out, in the First Region there was disorder, confusion reigned.226
