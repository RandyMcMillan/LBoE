The brothers bid a sentimental good-byeEnki sees the Past as a guide foretelling the Future He decides to commit all as a record for posterity. Colophon by the scribe EndubsarTHE FOURTEENTH TABLETBabili, where Marduk supremacy declared, by the Evil Wind was spared;All the lands south of Babili the Evil Wind devoured, the heart of the Second Region it also touched.When in the aftermath of the Great Calamity Enlil and Enki to surrey the havoc met, Enki to Enlil the sparing of Babili as a divine omen considered.That Marduk to supremacy has been destined, by the sparing of Babili is confirmed! So did Enki to Enlil say.The will of the Creator of All it must have been! Enlil to Enki said. Then to him the dream-vision and prophecy of Galzu Enlil revealed.If that by you was known, why did you the use of the Weapons of Terror not prevent? Enki him asked.My brother!

Whenever after your coming to Earth the mission by an obstacle obstructed was, A way the obstruction to circumvent we have found;Of that, the fashioning of the Earthlings, the greatest solution,Also the fountain of a myriad unwanted twists and turns was.When you have the celestial cycles fathomed and the constellations assigned, Who in them the hands of Destiny could foresee,Who could between our chosen fates and our unbending destiny distinguish? Who false omens proclaimed, who true prophecies could pronounce?235
