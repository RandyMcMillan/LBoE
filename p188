They saw that he was blinded, his testicles squashed, like a discarded jar he stood. Let Satu, blind and heirless, live! So did Asta to the council say.To end his days as a mortal, among the Igigi, the council his fate determined. Triumphant was Horon declared, the throne of his father to inherit;On a metal tablet was the council's decision inscribed, in the Hall of Records they placed it.In his abode Marduk with the decision was pleased; by what had happened he was sorrowed:Though Horon a son of Asar his son was, from Shamgaz the Igigi he was descended,A domain, one as among the Anunnaki allocated, to him was not given.Having lost both sons, in each other Marduk and Sarpanit solace sought.In time to them another son was born; Nabu, Prophecy Bearer, they named him.Now this is the account of why in the faraway a new chariot's place was built,And the love of Dumuzi and Inanna that Marduk by Dumuzi's death disrupted.It was after the contesting of Horon and Satu, and their aerial battle over Tilmun,That Enlil his three sons to a council summoned.With concern to them of what was happening, he said:In the beginning the Earthlings in our image and after our likeness we made,Now the Anunnaki offspring in the image and likeness of the Earthlings became!Then it was Ka-in who his brother killed, now a son of Marduk is his brother's killer!For the first time ever, an Anunnaki offspring from Earthlings an army raised,Weapons from a metal, of the Anunnaki a secret, in their hands he placed!From the days when by Alalu and Anzu our legitimacy was challenged,Disruption and rule-breaking by the Igigi continued.Now the beacon peaks in the domain of Marduk are located, the Landing Place by the Igigi is held,Now toward the Place of the Chariots the Igigi are advancing,188
