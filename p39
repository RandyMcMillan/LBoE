With his mace the hinder part he smashed to bits and pieces,Then strung them together as a band to form a Hammered Bracelet.Locking them together, as watchmen he stationed them,A Firmament to divide the waters from the waters.The Upper Waters above the Firmament from the Waters Below it he separated;Artful works Nibiru thus fashioned.The Lord then crossed the heavens to survey the regions;From Apsu's quarter to the abode of Gaga he measured the dimensions.The edge of the Deep Nibiru then examined, toward his birthplace he cast his gaze.He paused and hesitated; then to the Firmament, the Place of the Battle, slowly he returned. Passing again in Apsu's region, of the Sun's missing spouse he thought with remorse.He gazed upon Tiamat's wounded half, to her Upper Part he gave attention;The waters of life, her bounty, from the wounds were still pouring.Her golden veins Apsu's rays were reflecting.The Seed of Life, his Creator's legacy, Nibiru then remembered.When he trod on Tiamat, when he split her asunder, to her the seed he surely imparted!He addressed words to Apsu, to him thus saying:With your warming rays, to the wounds give healing!Let the broken part new life be given, in your family as a daughter to be,Let the waters to one place be gathered, let firm land appear!By Firm Land let her be called, Ki henceforth her name to be!Apsu to the words of Nibiru gave heed: Let the Earth join my family,Ki, Firm Land of the Below, let Earth her name henceforth be!By her turning let there day and night be; in the days my healing rays to her I shall provide.39
