Inside the stiff body of Asar lay, from its nostrils the breath of life departed.Marduk his clothes rent, on his forehead he put ashes.My son! My son! Sarpanit cried and wept, great were her grief and mourning.Enki was distraught and wept: The curse of Ka-in is repeated! to his son in agony he said. Asta to high heavens a wailing raised, to Marduk for revenge and an heir an appeal she made: Satu his death must meet. By your own seed a successor let me conceive,Let by your name his name remembered be, the lineage surviving!This, alas, cannot be done! Enki to Marduk and Asta said:The brother who killed, the brother's brother must be the keeper,For this Satu must be spared, by his seed an heir to Asar you must conceive!By these twists of fate Asta was baffled; distraught, the rules to defy she was determined. Before the body of Asar was wrapped and in the shroud in a shrine preserved,From his phallus Asta the life seed of Asar extracted.With it Asta herself made conceive, an heir and avenger to Asar to be born.To Enki and his sons, to Marduk and his brothers, Satu word delivered:The sole heir and Marduk's successor am I, of the Land of the Two Narrows I will be the master! Before the Anunnaki's council Asta the claim refuted: With Asar's heir I am with child.Among the river's bull rushes with the child she hid, the wrath of Satu she was avoiding;Horon she called the boy, to be his father's avenger she raised him.Satu by this was disconcerted; Shamgaz from ambitions did not retreat.From Earth year to Earth year the lgigi and their offspring from the Landing Place spread,Unto the borders of Tilmun, Ninharsag's sacred region, closer they moved.To overrun the Place of the Celestial Chariots the Igigi and their Earthlings threatened.In the dark-hued lands the child Horon by Earth's quick life cycles to a hero grew,186
