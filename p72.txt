Then to Enlil command was granted, Enki to the distant Abzu was delegated.My heart of all that was aching, my chest from shame and anger was bursting;Then Anu his foot upon my chest placed, upon my aching heart he was treading!In the silence Anu spoke up: By royal seed and law, by fair wrestling did I gain the throne.My malehood you bit off and swallowed, my offspring line to discontinue!Enlil spoke up: To the crime the accused admitted, let the judgment come,Let death the punishment be!Death! said Alalgar. Death! said Abgal. Death! said Nungal.Death to Alalu by itself will be coming, what he had swallowed in his innards death will bring! Enki was saying.Let Alalu for the rest of his days on Earth be in prison! Anzu was saying.Their words Anu was contemplating; anger and pity both him engulfed.To die in exile, let this be the judgment! Anu was saying.In amazement the judges at each other glanced. What Anu was saying they wondered. Neither on Earth nor on Nibiru shall the exiling be! Anu was saying.On the way there is the Lahmu planet, with waters and an atmosphere it is endowed. Enki, as Ea, thereon made a pause; of it as a way station have I been thinking.Its netforce is less than that of Earth forceful, an advantage in wisdom to be considered; In the celestial chariot Alalu shall be taken,On my departing from Earth he with me shall make the journey.Around the planet Lahmu we shall make circuits, to Alalu a sky chamber we shall provide, To the planet Lahmu in it he will be descended.Alone on a strange planet an exile he shall be,His days to his last day by himself to count!Thus did Anu words of judgment utter, in solemnity were the words intended.72
