Let Marduk surrender, let the bloodshed end! So did Enlil to Enki words convey; Let brother talk to brother! to Enki Ninharsag a message sent.In his hideout, within the Ekur, Marduk his pursuers to defy continued,Within the House Which Like a Mountain Is his final stand he made.Inanna the massive stone structure could not surmount, its smooth sides her weapons deflected.Then Ninurta of the secret entrance learned, the swivel stone on the north side he found! Through a dark corridor Ninurta passed, the grand gallery he reached,Its vault by the many-hued emissions of the crystals like a rainbow was aglitter.Inside, by the intrusion alerted, Marduk with ready weapons Ninurta awaited;With weapons responding, smashing the wonder crystals, Ninurta up the gallery kept going.Into the upper chamber, the place of the Great Pulsating Stone, Marduk retreated,At its entrance Marduk the sliding stone locks lowered; from one and all admission they barred.Into the Ekur Inanna and Ishkur Ninurta followed; what next to do they contemplated.Let the encased hiding chamber be Marduk's stone coffin! to them Ishkur said.To three blocking stones, ready for down gliding, Ishkur their attention drew.Let slow death, by alive being buried, be Marduk's sentence! Inanna her consent gave.At the end of the gallery, the three the blocking stones let loose,Each one of them one stone for plugging slid down, Marduk as in a tomb to seal.Now this is the account of how Marduk was saved and to exile departed,And how the Ekur was dismantled and lordship over the lands rearranged.Away from the Sun and light, without food or water, Marduk within the Ekur alive was entombed;By his imprisonment and punishment without trial Sarpanit, his spouse, a wailing raised. To Enki her father-in-law she hurried, with the young son Nabu to him she came.To be among the living Marduk must be returned! to Enki Sarpanit said.196
