Of its black-headed people, Shumer is emptied, gone is all life;Of its cattle and sheep Shumer is emptied, silent is the hum of churning milk.In its glorious cities, only the wind howls; death is the only smell.The temples whose heads to heaven arose by their gods have been abandoned.Of lordship and kingship command there is none; scepter and tiara are gone.On the banks of the two great rivers, once lush and life-giving, only weeds grow.No one treads the highways, no one seeks out the roads; flourishing Shumer is like an abandoned desert.How smitten is the land, home of gods and men!On that land a calamity fell, one unknown to man.A calamity that Mankind had never before seen, one that could not be withstood.On all the lands, from west to east, a disruptive hand of terror was placed. The gods, in their cities, were helpless as men!An Evil Wind, a storm born in a distant plain, a Great Calamity wrought in its path.A death-dealing wind born in the west its way to the east has made, its course set by fate.A storm devouring as the deluge, by wind and not by water a destroyer; by poisoned air, not tidal waves, overwhelming.By fate, not destiny, was it engendered; the great gods, in their council, the Great Calamity had caused.By Enlil and Ninharsag it was permitted; I alone for a halt was beseeching.Day and night to accept what the heavens decree I argued, to no avail!Ninurta, Enlil's warrior son, and Nergal, my very own son, poisoned weapons in the great plain then unleashed.That an Evil Wind shall follow the brilliance we knew not! they now cry in agony.That the death-dealing storm, born in the west, its course to the east shall make, who could foretell! the gods now bemoan.In their holy cities, the gods stood disbelieving as the Evil Wind toward Shumer made its way.11
