Deftly did Abgal spread the chariot's wings, its descent thereby arresting. Beyond lay the place of the chariots, a sight most inviting;Gently did Abgal the chariot bring down to a place by the beams selected. He opened the hatch; a multitude of populace was there assembled!Anu toward him stepped forward, locked arms, warm greetings uttered.Heroes into the chariot rushed, the gold-bearing baskets they brought out.High above their heads they the baskets held,To the assembled, words of victory Anu shouted: Salvation is here! to them he was saying. To the palace was Abgal accompanied, to rest and tell all he was escorted.The gold, a sight most dazzling, by the savants was quickly taken;To make of it the finest dust, to skyward launch it was hauled away.A Shar did the fashioning last, a Shar did the testing continue.With rockets was the dust heavenward carried, by crystals' beams was it dispersed.Where there was a breach, now there was a healing!Joy the palace filled, abundance in the land was expected.To Earth Anu good words was beaming: Gold gives salvation! The obtaining of gold do continue! When Nibiru near the Sun came, the golden dust was by its rays disturbed;The healing in the atmosphere was dwindled, the breach to bigness returned.Anu the return of Abgal to Earth then commanded; in the chariot more heroes traveled,In its bowels more That Which the Waters Sucks In and Thrusts Out were provided;With them Nungal to travel was commanded, a pilot-helper to Abgal to become.Great joy there was when Abgal to Erldu returned;Many greetings and the locking of arms there was!The new water-workings Ea with care contemplated;63
