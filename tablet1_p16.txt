Then a truce was declared; then peacemaking was conducted.Let the nations be united, the emissaries said to one another:Let there be one throne on Nibiru, one king to reign over all.Let a leader from north or from south by lot be chosen, one king supreme to be.If he be from north, let south choose a female to be his spouse as equal queen to reign alongside.If by lot a south male be chosen, let the north's female be his spouse. Husband and wife let them be, as one flesh to become.Let their firstborn son be the successor; let a unified dynasty thus be formed, unity on Nibiru forever to establish!In the midst of the ruins, peace was started. North and south by marriage were united. The royal throne into one flesh combined, an unbroken line of kingship established!The first king after peace was made, a warrior of the north he was, a mighty commander. By lots, true and fair, was he chosen; his decrees in unity were accepted.For his abode he built a splendid city; Agade, Unity meaning, was its name.For his reign a royal title he was granted; An it was, the Celestial One was its meaning.With strong arm order in the lands he reestablished; laws and regulations he decreed.Governors for each land he appointed; restoration and reclamation was their foremost task.Of him in the royal annals, thus it was recorded: An the lands unified, peace on Nibiru he restored.He built a new city, the canals he repaired, food to the people he provided; there was abundance in the lands.For his spouse the south a maiden had chosen; for both love and warring she was noted. An.Tu was her royal title; the Leader Who Is An's Spouse, the given name cleverly did mean.She bore An three sons and no daughters. The firstborn son was by her named An.Ki; By An a Solid Foundation was its meaning.Alone on the throne he was seated; a spouse to choose was twice postponed.In his reign, concubines were brought into the palace; a son to him was not born.16
