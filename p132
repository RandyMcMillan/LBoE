After Enlil had spoken, with Enlil his brother Enki agreed:Indeed, who of this would have thought! So to the others did Enki say.The brothers sat and contemplated; Ninmah with them was also deliberating.The command of Anu cannot be avoided! to them she said.Let Adapa by our young ones to Nibiru be accompanied, his fright to diminish, to Anu things explain!So did Enki to the others say. Let Ningishzidda and Dumuzi his companions be, By the way, Nibiru for the first time with their eyes also see!By Ninmah was the suggestion favored: Our young ones, on Earth born,Of Nibiru are forgetting, its life cycles by those of Earth are overwhelmed;Let the two sons of Enki, as yet unmarried, to Nibiru also travel, Perchance brides there for themselves they shall find!When the next celestial chamber from Nibiru did arrive in Sippar, Ilabrat, a vizier of Anu, from the chamber stepped off.I have come to fetch the Earthling Adapa! So to the leaders he said.The leaders to Ilabrat Adapa presented; Titi and her sons to him they also showed. Indeed, in our image and after our likeness they are! So did Ilabrat say.To Ilabrat Ningishzidda and Dumuzi, sons of Enki, were presented.To accompany Adapa on his journey they have been selected! to him Enki said.Anu his grandchildren to see will be pleased! So did Ilabrat say.To hear instructions, Enki Adapa to him summoned. To Adapa thus he said:Adapa, to Nibiru, the planet whence we had come, you will be going,Before Anu our king you will come, to his majesty you will be presented;Before him you shall bow. Speak only when asked, to questions short answers give! New clothing you will be given; the new garments put on.132
