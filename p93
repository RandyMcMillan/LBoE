In celestial chariots from Lahmu to Nibiru was the pure gold delivered.As by Ninurta conceived, from the Abzu to Nibiru the gold flowed;What was not conceived was unrest by the newcoming Anunnaki who in the Abzu toiled! Truth be said, Enki to what was brewing heed was not giving,To other matters in the Abzu his attention was directing.With that which in the Abzu grows and lives fascination he acquired;Of the differences between what on Earth and what on Nibiru appeared he wished to learn, How maladies by Earth's cycles and atmosphere were caused he wished to uncover.In the Abzu, by the gushing waters, a wondrous study place he erected,With all manner of tools and equipment he furnished it.House of Life he called the place, to it his son Ningishzidda he invited.Sacred Formulas, tiny ME's, the secrets of life and death possessing they shaped,The mysteries of living and dying of Earth's creatures they to unravel sought.With some living creatures Enki was especially enamored;They lived among the tall trees, their front legs as hands they were using.In the tall grasses of the steppes odd creatures were seen; erect they seemed to be walking. Absorbed was Enki in those studies; what was among the Anunnaki brewing he noticed not. First to notice trouble was Ninurta: A lessening of gold ores at Bad-Tibira he observed.By Enlil was Ninurta to the Abzu dispatched, what was ongoing to discover.By Ennugi, the Chief Officer, to the excavations he was accompanied,Complaints of the Anunnaki he with his own ears heard;They were backbiting and lamenting, in the excavations they were grumbling;Unbearable is the toil! to Ninurta they were saying.Ninurta this to his uncle Erik I reported. Let us Enlil summon! Enki said.93
