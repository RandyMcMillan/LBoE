A son from Enlil's seed she bore, Ninurta the two have named him.By the deed was Anu angered; as punishment he Ninmah ever to be a spouse forbade!Ea his bride-to-be by Anu's decree abandoned, a princess named Damkina he instead espoused;A son, an heir, to them was born; Marduk they named him, One in a Pure Pace Born it meant.
