At the Place of the Celestial Chariots the command was given, to Alalu words were spoken: Anu the king, to you his greetings sends; of your well-being to learn he is pleased;For your departing from Nibiru there was no reason, enmity is not in Anu's heart;If gold for salvation you have indeed discovered, let Nibiru be saved!The words of Anu Alalu's chariot did reach; Alalu them quickly answered: If your savior I am to be, your lives to save,Convene the princes to assembly, my ancestry declare supreme!Let the commanders make me their leader, bow to my command!Let the council pronounce me king, on the throne Anu to replace!When the words of Alalu on Nibiru were heard, great was the consternation.How could Anu be deposed? the counselors asked each other. What if Alalu mischief, not truth, is tellingWhere is his asylum? Did gold indeed he find?They summoned the sages, of the wise and learned counseling they asked.The oldest of them spoke: I was Alalu's master! he was saying.He had hearkened to teachings of the Beginning, of the Celestial Battle he was learning;Of the watery monster Tiamat and her golden veins he knowledge acquired;If indeed beyond the Hammered Bracelet he had journeyed,On Earth, the seventh planet, is his asylum!In the assembly a prince spoke up: a son of Anu he was, of the womb of Antu, Anu's spouse, he was the issue.Enlil was his name, Lord of the Command it meant. Words of caution he was saying:Of conditions Alalu cannot speak. Calamities were his handiwork, by single combat in wrestling he the throne forfeited.If Tiamat's gold he indeed had found, proof of that is needed; Is it for protecting our atmosphere sufficient?46
