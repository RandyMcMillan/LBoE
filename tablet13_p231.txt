To no one, until the fateful decision was made, did Enlil his knowledge of the terror's hiding place disclose!When, despite all protestations, the council to use the Weapons of Terror permitted,When Enki, angry and distraught the council chamber left,In his heart was Enki smiling: Only he knew where the weapons were hidden! So did Enki think,For it was he, before Enlil to Earth had come, who with Abgal in a place unknown the weapons did hide.That Abgal, to the exiled Enlil, the place disclosed, that to Enki was unknown!When Enki this second secret heard, in his heart a wishful thought he harbored:That after such a long sojourn, the weapons' terror would have evaporated!Little did Enki expect the long sojourn a calamity as never before known on Earth to cause. Thus it was that without Enki needing, Enlil to the two heroes the hiding place disclosed: Those seven Weapons of Terror, in a mountain they abide! to them Enlil said.In a cavity inside the earth they dwell, with the terror to clad them is required!Then the secret of how the weapons from their deep sleep awaken, Enlil to them did reveal.Before the two sons, one of Enlil, one of Enki, to the hiding place departed,Enlil to them words of forewarning said: Ere the weapons are used, by the Anunnaki must the chariots' place be vacated;The cities must be spared, the people must not perish!In his skyship Nergal to the hiding place soared, Ninurta by his father was delayed;A word to his son alone Enlil wished to say, a secret to him alone reveal:About the prophecy of Galzu and the choosing of lbruum to Ninurta he told.Hot-headed is Nergal, make sure that the cities are spared, that Ibruum is forewarned! to Ninurta Enlil said.When Ninurta at the weapons' place arrived, Nergal from the cavity had already them brought out,As their ME's from the long slumber he awakened, to each one of the seven Nergal a taskname gave:231
