Before for the distant lands the royal couple went, the Edin and its lands Anu and Antu surveyed;Eridu and Nibru-ki they visited, where the cities of the first region were planned they saw. In Eridu Enlil about Enki complained: The ME formulas to himself Enki is keeping!Anu, on the seat of honor seated, words of praise to Enki said:My son for himself a magnificent house built, beautifully on a platform it is raised.To the people that the House surround and serve, great knowledge will Enki give;Now, the knowledge that in the ME's is secreted, with other Anunnaki must be shared!Embarrassed was Enki; to share with all the divine formulas to Anu he promised.In the ensuing days, in skyships traveling, Anu and Antu the other regions surveyed.Then, on the seventeenth day, to Unug-ki the royal couple returned for one more night of restIn the morrow, when the younger Anunnaki before Anu and Antu for a blessing came,Anu to his great-granddaughter Inanna took a liking; he drew her closely, he hugged and kissed her.Let all my words heed! to the congregated he announced:This place, after we leave, to Inanna as a dowry is given,Let the skyship in which we the Earth shall survey to Inanna my present be!Joyed, Inanna to dance and sing began, her praises of Anu as hymns in times to come were chanted.Thereafter, bidding farewells to the Anunnaki, for the lands beyond the oceans Anu and Antu departed;Enlil and Enki, Ninurta and Ishkur with them to the golden land wentTo impress Anu the king with the great golden richess, Ninurta an abode for Anu and Antu built; Its stone blocks, to perfection cut, with pure gold inside were covered.A golden enclosure, with flowers of carnelian stones carved, the royal couple awaited!By the shore of the great mountain lake was the abode erected.How the gold nuggets are collected the visitors were shown;There is gold here enough for many Shars to come! Anu, satisfied, said.206
