To receive our essence in graduations it must be shaped,From the ME formulas of Nibiru's essence only bit by bit could be attempted!In a crystal vessel Ninmah an admixture was preparing, the oval of a female two-legged she gently placed,With ME Anunnaki seed containing, she the oval impregnated;That oval back into the womb of the two-legged female she inserted.This time there was conceiving, a birth was indeed forthcoming!The allotted time for birth-giving the leaders awaited, with anxious hearts they results were seeking.The allotted time arrived, there was no birth-giving!In desperation Ninmah a cutting made, that which was conceived with tongs she drew out. A living being it was!With glee Enki Shouted. We attained! Ningishzidda with joy cried out.In her hands Ninmah the newborn held, with joy she was not filled:Shaggy with hair all over was the newborn, his foreparts like of the Earth creatures were, His hindparts to those of the Anunnaki more akin they were.They let the two-legged female the newborn nurse, with her milk him to suckle.Fast was the newborn growing, what on Nibiru a day was, a month in the Abzu was.Taller the Earth child grew, in the image of the Anunnaki he was not;His hands for tools were not suited, his speech only grunting sounds was!We must try once more! Ninmah was saying. The admixture needs adjusting;Let me the ME's assay, with this or that ME make the endeavor!With Enki and Ningishzidda assisting, they repeated the procedures,The essences in the ME's Ninmah carefully considered,One bit she took from one, one bit she took out from another,Then in the crystal bowl the oval of an Earth female she inseminated.101
