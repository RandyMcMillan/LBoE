Eager to see Ziusudra depart, the townspeople to the boat food and water brought,From their own mouths sustenance they took; to appease Enlil they were in a hurry!Four-legged animals into the boat were also driven, birds from the field by themselves flew in.Into the boat Ziusudra his spouse and sons made embark, their wives and children also came.Any who to the abode of the lord Enki wish to go, let them too aboard come!So did Ziusudra to the gathered people announce.Envisioning Enlil's abundance, only some of the craftsmen the call heeded.On the sixth day Ninagal, Lord of the Great Waters, to the boat came,A son of Enki he was, to be the boat's navigator he was selected.A box of cedarwood in his hands he held, by his side in the boat he kept it;The life essences and life eggs of living creatures it contains, by the lord Enki and Ninmah collected,From the wrath of Enlil to be hidden, to life resurrect if Earth be willing!So did Ninagal to Ziusudra explain; thus were all beasts by their twos in the boat hidden.Now Ninagal and Ziusudra in the boat the arrival of the seventh day awaited.In the one hundred and twentieth Shar was the Deluge awaited,In the tenth Shar in the life age of Ziusudra was the Deluge forthcoming,In the station of the Constellation of the Lion was the avalanche looming.Now this is the account of the Deluge that over the Earth sweptAnd how the Anunnaki escaped, and how Ziusudra in the boat survived.For days before the Day of the Deluge the Earth was rumbling, groan as with pain it did;For nights before the calamity struck, in the heavens Nibiru as a glowing star was seen;Then there was darkness in daytime, and at night the Moon as though by a monster was swallowed.The Earth began to shake, by a netforce before unknown it was agitated. In the glow of dawn, a black cloud arose from the horizon,170
