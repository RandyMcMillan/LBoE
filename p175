On my oath, the annihilation of Mankind shall never be repeated!Relenting, Enlil by the hands Ziusudra and Emzara his spouse took and blessed them thus: Be fruitful and multiply, and the Earth replenish!Thus were the Olden Times ended.Now this is the account of how survival on Earth was restored,And how a new source of gold and other Earthlings beyond the oceans were found.It was after the encounter at Arrata that the waters of the Deluge to recede continued,And the face of the Earth gradually from under the waters was showing.The mountainlands were mostly unscathed, but the valleys under mud and silt were buried.
