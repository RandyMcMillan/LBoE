Nin.Shar she was called bear of the Shars the Lady. A son she did not bear.By a concubine to Enshar a son was born; the Firstborn son he was.By Ninshar First Wife and half sister, a son was not brought forth.By the Law of Succession, the concubine's son the throne ascended; the seventh to reign he was.Du-Uru was his royal name; In the Dwelling Place Fashioned was its meaning; In the house of Concubines, not in the palace, was he indeed conceived.As his spouse a maiden from his youth beloved Duuru chose; by love, not by seed, a First Wife he selected.Da.Uru was her royal name; She Who Is by My Side was the meaning.In the royal court confusion was rampant. Sons were not heirs, wives were not half sisters.In the land suffering was increasing. The fields forgot their abundance, among the people fertility was diminished.In the palace fertility was absent; neither son nor daughter was brought forth.Of An's seed seven were the rulers; then of his seed the throne was dry.Dauru a child at the palace gateway found; as a son she embraced him.Duuru in the end as a son him adopted, Legal Heir him decreed; Lahma, meaning Dryness, was his given name.In the palace the princes were grumbling; in the Council of Counselors there were complaints.In the end Lahma the throne ascended. Though not of An's seed, he was the eighth to reign.In the councils of the learned, to heal the brach there were two suggestions:One was to use a metal, gold was its name. On Nibiru it was greatly rare; within the Hammered Bracelet it was abundant.It was the only substance that to the finest powder could be ground; lofted high to heaven, suspended it could remain.Thus, with replenishments, the breach it would heal, protection make better. Let celestial boats be built, let a celestial fleet the gold to Nibiru bring over!21
