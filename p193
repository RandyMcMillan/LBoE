Then by an avalanche of waters the Earth was swept over,In waters did Asar my grandchild drown, by waters my beloved Dumuzi is now dead!Everything I had done, for righteous purpose did I do it.Why am I punished, why has Fate against me turned?So did Enki bewail and lament.When from Geshtinanna the veracity of occurrences was discovered,Greater was Enki's agony: Now Marduk, my firstborn, for his deed will also suffer!By the disappearance and death of Dumuzi was Inanna worried, then grieved;Then to the Lower Abzu she hurried, Dumuzi's body for burial to retrieve.When Ereshkigal, her sister, of the arrival of Inanna at the precinct's gates was told,Ereshkigal a devious scheme on the part of Inanna suspected.At each of the seven gates, one of Inanna's accoutrements and weapons was from her removed,Then, unclothed and powerless before Ereshkigal's throne,Of scheming an heir by Nergal, Dumuzi's brother, she was accused!Trembling with fury, Ereshkigal to her sister's explanations would not listen.Let loose against her the sixty diseases! Ereshkigal her vizier, Namtar, in anger ordered.By the disappearance of Inanna in the Lower Abzu were her parents much worried,Nannar to Enlil in the matter went, Enlil to Enki a message sent.From Nergal his son, Ereshkigal's spouse, Enki what had happened learned,From clay of the Abzu Enki two emissaries fashioned, beings without blood, by death rays unharmed,To the Lower Abzu he sent them, Inanna to bring back, whether alive or dead.When before Ereshkigal they came, Ereshkigal by their appearance was puzzled:Are you Anunnaki? Are you Earthlings? with bewilderment she asked them.Namtar the magical weapons of power against them directed, but unharmed the two were.193
