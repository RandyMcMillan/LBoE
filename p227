In the First Region kingship was in disarray, from Cities of Gods to Cities of Man it moved about,Unug-ki, Lagash, Urim and Kish, Isin and to faraway places kingship was shifting. Then Enlil, with Anu consulting, kingship in the hands of Nannar deposited;To Urim, in whose soil the divine Heavenly Bright Object remained implanted, kingship for the third time was granted.In Urim a Righteous Shepherd of men Nannar as king appointed, Ur-Nammu was his name.Equity in the lands Ur-Nammu established, to violence and strife an end he made, in all the lands prosperity was abundant.It was at that time that in the nighttime Enlil a dream-vision had:The image of a man to him appeared, bright and shining like the heavens he was;As he approached and by Enlil's bed stood, Enlil the white-haired Galzu recognized!In his left hand a tablet of lapis lazuli he was holding, the starry heavens on it were designed;By the twelve constellation signs were the heavens divided, to them with his left hand Galzu pointed.From the Bull to the Ram Galzu his pointing shifted; three times the pointing he repeated. Then in the dream-vision Galzu spoke up and to Enlil thus said:The righteous time of benevolence and peace by evildoing and bloodshed will be followed. In three celestial portions the Ram of Marduk the Bull of Enlil will replace,One who himself as Supreme God has declared supremacy on Earth will seize.A calamity as has never before occurred, by Fate decreed, will happen!As at the time of the Deluge, a righteous and worthy man must be chosen,By him and his seed will Civilized Mankind, as by the Creator of All intended, be preserved! So did Galzu, the divine emissary, to Enlil in the dream-vision say.When Enlil from the nighttime dream-vision awakened, there was no tablet beside his bed. Was it an oracle from heaven or did I it all in my heart imagine? Enlil to himself wondered. To none of his sons, Nannar among them, nor to Ninlil did he of the dream-vision tell.227
