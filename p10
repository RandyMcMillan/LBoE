With heavy spirit I utter laments; laments that are bitter fill my heart.How smitten is the land, its people delivered to the Evil Wind, its stables abandoned, its sheepfolds emptied.How smitten are the cities, their people piled up as dead corpses, afflicted by the Evil Wind. How smitten are the fields, their vegetation withered, touched by the Evil Wind.How smitten are the rivers, nothing swims anymore, pure sparkling waters turned into poison.10
