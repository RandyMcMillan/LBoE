When the law was changed, the other princes were contending. Words there were, rebellion there was not.As his spouse Anshar a half sister chose. He made her First Wife; by the name Ki.Shar she was called.Thus was by this law the dynasty continued.In the reign of Anshar, the fields diminished their yields, fruits and grains lost abundance.From circuit to circuit, nearing the Sun heat grew stronger; in the faraway abode, coolness was more biting.In Agade, the throne city, the king those of great understanding assembled.Learned savants, those of great knowledge, to inquire were commanded.The land and the soil they examined, the lakes and streams they put to the test.It has happened before, some gave an answer: Nibiru in the past colder or warmer has grown;A destiny it is, in the Circuit of Nibiru embedded!Others of know edge, the circuit observing, Nibiru's destiny to blame did not consider.In the atmosphere a breaching ha, occurred; that was their finding.Volcanoes, the atmosphere, forebear, less belching were spitting up!Nibiru's air has thinner been made, the protective shild has been diminished!In the reign of Anshar and Kishar, pestilences art field made appearance; toil could them not overcomeTheir son En.Shar then the throne ascended; Of the dynasty the sixth he was.Lordly Master of the Shar the name did signify.With great understanding he was born, with much learning he mastered much knowledge.To remedy the afflictions ways he sought; of Nibiru heavenly circuit he made much study.In its loop, of the Sun's family five members it embraced, planets of dazzling beauty.For cures to the afflictions, their atmospheres he caused to be examined.To each he gave a name, ancestral forefathers he honored; as heavenly couples he them considered.An and Antu, the twin like planets, he called the first two to be encountered.19
