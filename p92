Ninurta in the innards of planets learned was; to his elders words of wisdom he was saying: Let a Metal City be established, therein the gold ores to be smelted and refined,Therefrom less weighty cargoes from Earth shall be lofted.Each rocketship more gold could carry, room for Anunnaki to Nibiru return there shall be, Let the tired to Nibiru return, let fresh ones them on Earth replace!Enlil and Enki and Ninmah of Ninurta's suggestion were in favor,Anu was consulted and his approval gave.In the Edin was the Metal City planned, on that location Enlil did insist!With materials from Nibiru was it constructed, with tools from Nibiru was it equipped.Three Shars the construction lasted, Bad-Tibira was it the name given.Ninurta, who made the suggestion, was its first commander.The flow of gold to Nibiru was thereby eased and quickened,Those who to Earth and Lahmu at the beginning of the Prior Times had comeTo Nibiru were returning; Alalgar and Abgal and Nungal among them were.The newcomers who them replaced were younger and eager;To the cycles of Earth and Lahmu and the other rigors they were not accustomed.On Nibiru, whence they had come, the breach in the atmosphere was healing;The great calamities on the planet and in its heavens the younger ones did not know.Of their golden mission excitement and adventure they especially cherished!As by Ninurta conceived, the ores from the Abzu were delivered,In Bad-Tibira they were smelted and refined, by rocketships to Lahmu they were sent;92
