And then at last the path was clear; unharmed the chariot could continue!A cry of joy the heroes sounded; double was the joy as the sight ofthe Sun was now unveiled.Amidst the elation Anzu the alarm sounded: For the path to have fashioned, excessive waters were Consumed,Waters to feed the chariot's Fiery Stones for the remaining journey were not sufficient, In the dark deepness the sixth planet they could see, the Sun's rays it was reflecting.There is water on Lahmu, Ed was saving. Can you bring the chariot clown upon it? Anzu he was asking.Deftly Anzu the chariot toward Lahmu directed; reaching the celestial god, around it he the chariot made circle.The planet's net is not great, its pull is to handle easy, Anzu was saying.A sight to behold was Lahmu, many hued it was; snow white was its cap, snow white were its sandals.Reddish hued was its middle, in its midst lakes and rivers were aglitterlDeftly Anzu the chariot made travel slower, by a lakeside it gently came down.Ea and Anzu their Eagles helmets donned, to the firm ground they stepped down.On command the heros That Which Water Sucks extended, the chariot, bowels with the lake's waters to fill.While the chariot was getting its fill of waters, Ea and Anzu the whereabouts examined.With Tester and Sampler all that matters they ascertained: The waters were good for drinking, the air was insufficient.All was in the chariot's annals recorded, the need for the detour described.With its vigor replenished the chariot soared up, to benevolent Lahmu farewell bidding.Beyond the seventh planet was making its circuit; Earth and its companion the chariot were inviting!In the commander's seat Anzu was without words; Ea too was silent.Ahead was their destination, its gold Nibiru's fate for salvation or doom containing.'The chariot must be slowed or in Earth's thick atmosphere it shall perish! Anzu to Ea declared. Around Earth's companion, the Moon, make slowing circles! Ea to him suggested.51
