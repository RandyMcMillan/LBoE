Let Kingu be a creature of the night, to shine at night 1 shall appoint him Earth's companion, the Moon forever to be!Nibiru the Words of Apsu with satisfaction heard.He crossed the heavens and surveyed the regions,To the gods who had him elevated he granted permanent stations,Their circuits he destined that none shall transgress nor fall short of each other.He strengthened the heavenly locks, gates on both sides he established.An outermost abode he chose for himself, beyond Gaga were its dimensions.The great circuit to be his destiny he beseeched Apsu for him to decree.All the gods spoke up from their stations: Let Nibiru's sovereignty be surpassing!Most radiant of the gods he is, let him truly the Son of the Sun be!From his quarter Apsu gave his blessing:Nibiru shall hold the crossing of Heaven and Earth; Crossing shall be his name!The gods shall cross over neither above nor below;He shall hold the central position, the shepherd of the gods he shall be.A Shar shall be his circuit; that his Destiny will forever be!Now this is the account of how the Olden Times began,And of the era that in the Annals the Golden Era by name was known,And how from Nibiru to Earth the missions went the gold to obtain.The escape of Alalu from Nibiru was its beginning.With great understanding was Alalu endowed, much knowledge he by learning acquired. By his forefather Anshargal of the heavens and the circuits much knowledge was amassed, By Enshar was knowledge greatly augmented;Of that Alalu made much learning; with the sages he discoursed, savants and commanders he consulted.40
