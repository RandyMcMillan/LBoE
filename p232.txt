The One Without Rival the first weapon he called, the Blazing Flame he named the second, The One Who with Terror Crumbles he called the third, Mountain Melter the fourth he called,Wind That the Rim of the World Seeks he named the fifth, the One Who Above and Below No One Spares was the sixth,The seventh with monstrous venom was filled, Vaporizer of Living Things he called itWith Anu's blessing were the seven to Nergal and Ninurta given, therewith to destruction wreak.When Ninurta at the place of the Weapons of Terror arrived, to destroy and annihilate was Nergal ready.I shall kill the son I will annihilate the father! Nergal with vengeance was shouting.The lands they covet will vanish, the sinning cities I will upheaval! So did Nergal enraged announce.Valiant Nergal, will you the righteous with the unrighteous destroy? So did Ninurta his comrade ask.The instructions of Enlil are clear! To the selected targets the way I will lead, you behind me will follow!The decision of the Anunnaki to me is known! Nergal to Ninurta said.For seven days and seven nights the signal from Enlil the two awaited.As was his intention, when his waiting was completed, Marduk to Babili returned,In the presence of his followers, with weapons armed, his supremacy he declared;A thousand and seven hundred and thirty-six was the count of Earth years then.On that day, on that fateful day, Enlil to Ninurta the signal sent;To Mount Mashu Ninurta departed, behind him Nergal followed.The Mount and the plain, in the heart of the Fourth Region, Ninurta from the skies surveyed. With a squeezing in his heart, to Nergal a sign he gave: Keep off! to him he signaled.Then the first terror weapon from the skies Ninurta let loose;The top of Mount Mashu with a flash it sliced off, the mount's innards in an instant it melted. Above the Place of the Celestial Chariots the second weapon he unleashed,With a brilliance of seven suns the plain's rocks into a gushing wound were made,232
