Therefrom the gold directly from Earth to Nibiru to be carried,No way station on Lahmu shall henceforth be needed;The plan of Ninurta it is, great in these matters is his understanding,Let him the Place of the Chariots near Bad-Tibira establish,Let Ninurta be its first commander!Anu to the words of Enlil gave much consideration; to Enlil a response he gave:Enki and Marduk to Earth are returning;What about the Moon they have found, let us first to their words listen!From the Moon Enki and Marduk departed, to Earth they did return;Of conditions thereon they gave account; a way station is unfeasible now! so they reported. Let the Place of the Chariots be built! Anu was saying.Let Marduk be its commander! Enki was saying to Anu.The task is for Ninurta set aside! Enlil with anger shouted.For the Igigi command is no more needed, of the tasks Marduk knowledge has,Of the Gateway to Heaven let Marduk be in charge! So did Enki to his father say.Anu the matter with concern contemplated: Rivalries now the sons have affected!With wisdom was Anu endowed, with wisdom were his decisions:The Place of the Chariots for new ways the gold to handle is designated,Let us what henceforth comes in the hands of a new generation place.Neither Enlil nor Enki, neither Ninurta nor Marduk in command shall be,Let the third generation responsibility undertake, let Utu be the commander!Let the Place of the Celestial Chariots be built, let Sippar, Bird City, be its name!This was the word of Anu; unalterable was the word of the king.In the eighty-first Shar was the construction started, the plans of Enlil it followed.123
