In the name of Satu to all the Heaven-Earth facilities they claim will lay!So did Enlil to his three sons say, to take countersteps to them he proposed:An alternative Heaven-Earth facility in secret establish we must!Let it in Ninurta's land beyond the oceans, in the midst of trusted Earthlings, come to be! Thus was the secret mission in the hands of Ninurta entrusted;In the mountainlands beyond the oceans, beside the great lake,A new Bond Heaven-Earth he was setting up, within an enclosure he placed it;At the foot of the mountains where the gold nuggets were scatteredA plain with firm ground he chose; on it for ascent and descent markings he made.Primitive are the facilities, but the purpose they will serve!So did Ninurta to his father Enlil in good time declare:From there gold shipments to Nibiru can continue, from there in need we too can ascend!At that time what as a blessed event began as a horrible occurrence ended.At that time Dumuzi, Enki's youngest son, to Inanna, Nannar's daughter, a liking took; Inanna, Enlil's granddaughter, by the lord of herding was captivated.A love that knows no bounds engulfed them, a passion their hearts inflamed.Many of the love songs that for a long time thereafter were sung,Inanna and Dumuzi were the first to sing them, by song their love they recounted.To Dumuzi, his youngest son, Enki a large domain above the Abzu allotted;Meluhha, the Black Land, was its name, highland trees there grew, its waters abundant were. Large bulls among its river reeds roamed, greatly numbered were its cattle,Silver from its mountains came, its copper bright as gold was aglitter.Greatly beloved was Dumuzi; by Enki after the death of Asar he was favored.Of his youngest brother Marduk was jealous.189
