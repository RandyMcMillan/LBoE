He spread his net, for Nibiru four servants he brought forth,His host by his side to be: the South Wind, the North Wind, the Fast Wind, the West Wind.With joyful heart An to Anshar his forebear the arrival of Nibiru announced.Anshar upon this hearing, Gaga, who was by his side, as an emissary sent forthWords of wisdom to An deliver, a task to Nibiru to assign.He charged Gaga to give voice to what was in his heart, to An thus say:Tiamat, she who bore us, now detests us;She has set up a warring host, she is furious with rage.Against the gods, her children, eleven warriors march by her side;Kingu among them she elevated, a destiny to his chest she attached without right.No god among us against her venom can stand up, her host in us all has fear established.Let Nibiru become our Avenger!Let him vanquish Tiamat, let him save our lives!For him decree a fate, let him go forth and face our mighty foe!To An Gaga departed; he bowed before him, the words of Anshar he repeated.An to Nlbiru his forebear's words repeated, Gaga's message to him he revealed.To the words Nibiru with wonder listened; of the mother who would her children devour with fascination he heard.His heart, without saying, to set out against Tiamat him already prompted. He opened his mouth, to An and Gaga he thus said:If indeed I am to vanquish Tiamat your lives to save,Convene the gods to assembly, my destiny proclaim supreme!Let all the gods agree in council to make me the leader, bow to my command! When Lahmu and Lahamu heard this, they cried out with anguish:Strange was the demand, its meaning cannot be fathomed! Thus they said.35
