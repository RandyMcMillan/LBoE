At the planet of gold he victoriously arrived.Now this is the account of the Earth and its gold;It is an account of the Beginning and how the celestial gods created were.In the Beginning,When in the Above the gods in the heavens had not been called into being,And in the Below Ki, the Firm Ground, had not yet been named,Alone in the void there existed Apsu, their Primordial Begetter.In the heights of the Above, the celestial gods had not yet been created;In the waters of the Below, the celestial gods had not yet appeared.Above and Below, the gods had not yet been formed, destinies were not yet decreed.No reed had yet been formed, no marshland had appeared;Alone did Apsu reign in the void.Then by his winds the primordial waters were mingled,A divine and artful spell Apsu upon the waters cast.On the void's deep he poured a sound sleep;Tiamat, the Mother of All, as a spouse for himself he fashioned.A celestial mother, a watery beauty she was indeed!Beside him Apsu little Mummu then brought forth,As his messenger he him appointed, a gift for Tiamat to present.A gift resplendent to his spouse Apsu granted:A shining metal, the everlasting gold, for her alone to possess!Then it was that the two their waters mingled, divine children between them to bring forth. Male and female were the celestials created; Lahmu and Lahamu by names they were called. In the Below did Apsu and Tiamat make them an abode.32
