The dynasty thus begun was by the death of Anki disrupted; on the foundation no offspring followed.The middle son, though not the firstborn, the Legal Heir was pronounced.From his youth, one of three brothers, Ib by his mother was lovingly called. The One in the Middle his name did mean.By the royal annals An.lb he is named: In kingship celestial; by generations, the One Who Is An's Son the name signified.He followed his father An on Nibiru's throne; by count, he was the third to reign.The daughter of his younger brother he chose to be his spouse. Nin.lb she was called, the Lady of lb.A son to Anib by Ninib was born; the successor on the throne he was, the fourth by the count of kings.By the royal name An.Shar.Gal he wished himself to be known; An's Prince Who Is Greatest of Princes was the meaning.His spouse, a half sister, K1.ShaY.Gal was equally named.Knowledge and understanding were his chief ambition; the ways of the heavens he assiduously studied.The great circuit of Nibiru he studied, its length a Shar to be he fixed.As one year of Nibiru was the measure, by it the royal reigns to be numbered and recorded. The Shar to ten portions he divided, two festivals thereby he pronounced.When nearest to the Sun's quarters, a festival of the warmth was celebrated.When to its far abode Nibiru was distanced, the festival of coolness was decreed.Replacing all olden festivals of tribes and nations, to unify the people the two were established. Laws of husband and wife, of sons and daughters, by decree he established;Customs from the first tribes he proclaimed for the whole land.From the wars females greatly outnumbered males.Decrees he made, one male to have more than one female for knowing.By law, one wife as official spouse to be chosen, First Wife to be called.By law, the firstborn son was his father's successor.17
