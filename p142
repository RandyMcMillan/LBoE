Whether they to procreate were able our king Anu in doubt was,By the birth of Ka-in and Abael were Anu and the council on Nibiru convinced.A new phase of Anunnaki presence on this planet was welcomed and approved;Now that Abael has been slain, and if Ka-in too shall be extinguished,Satiation to an end would come, mutinies will be repeated, all that was achieved shall crumble!No wonder that to Abael a liking you took, the son of your half brother he was!Now, on the other one have pity, let the line of Adapa survive!So did Enki with sadness a secret to Marduk his son reveal.By the revelation Marduk was at first astounded, then by laughter he was overcome:Of your lovemaking prowess much to me was rumored, now of that convinced I am!Indeed, let Ka-in's life be spared, to the ends of the Earth let him be banished!So did Marduk, from anger to laughter changing, to his father say.In Eridu judgment upon Ka-in by Enki was pronounced:Eastward to a land of wandering for his evil deed Ka-in must depart,That his life must be spared, he and his generations shall be distinguished!By Ningishzidda was the life essence of Ka-in altered:That his face a beard should not grow, Ka-ins life essence Ningishzidda changed.With his sister Awan as a spouse Ka-in from the Edin departed, to the Land of Wandering he set his course.Now the Anunnaki sat and among themselves wondered:Without Abael, without Ka-in, who shall for us the grains grow and bread make, Who shall be the shepherd, the ewes multiply, wool for clothing provide?Let by Adapa and Titi more proliferation be! So did the Anunnaki say.With the blessing of Enki, Adapa his spouse Titi knew again and again;One daughter, another daughter, each time again and again were born.142
