On a life or death mission w we have come; in our hands is Nibiru's fate!He looked about, for a place for encampment he was searching.Heap up soil, mounds fashion there! Ea gave command, an encampment to set up.To a place not afar he was pointing, a reed-hut abode by Alalu erected.To Anzu then words he directed: To Nibiru words by beaming deliver,To the king my father, Anu, successful arrival announce!Soon the hue of the skies was changing, from brightness to reddish it was turning.A sight never seen before their eyes was unfolding: The Sun, as a red ball, on the horizon was disappearing!Fear seized the heroes, of a Great Calamity afraid they were!Alalu with laughter words of comfort was saying: A setting of the Sun it is,The ending of one day on Earth it is marking.For a quick rest lie down; a night on Earth is beyond imagining short.Before you expect the Sun will an appearance make; on Earth it will be morning!Before expecting, darkness came, the heavens from the Earth it separated.Lightnings the darkness pierced, rains the thunders followed.By winds were the waters blown, storms of an alien god they were.In the chariot the heroes hunkered down, in the chariot the heroes huddled.Resting to them did not come; they were greatly agitated.With quickened hearts the Sun's return they awaited.Smiling when its rays appeared they were, joyful and backslapping.And it was evening and it was morning, their first day on Earth it was.By daybreak Ea the ongoings considered; to separate waters from waters heed he was giving. Engur he made of the sweet waters the master, drinking waters to provide.To the snake pond with Alalu he went, its sweet waters to consider54
