Alalu bent his knee, to the ground Alalu fell;Anu on the chest of Alalu with his foot pressed down, victory in the wrestling thereby declaring.By wrestling the decision was made; I am the king, to Nibiru Alalu shall not return!So was Anu saying as he removed his foot from the fallen Alalu.Up as a lightning Alalu from the ground arose. By the legs Anu he pulled down.His mouth was wide open, swiftly he the malehood of Anu bit off,The malehood of Anu did Alalu swallow!In pained agony did Anu a cry to the heavens shout; to the ground wounded he fell.Enki to the fallen Anu rushed, Enlil the laughing Alalu captive held.Heroes Anu to his but carried, words of accursation against Alalu he uttered.Let justice be done! Enlil to his lieutenant shouted. With your beam-weapon let Alalu be killed!No! No! Enki fiercely shouted. Justice is within him, in his innards poison has entered! They took Alalu to a reed hut, his hands and feet as a prisoner they bound.Now this is the account of the judging of Alalu,And of the happenings thereafter on Earth and on Lahmu.In his reed hut Anu was hurting, in the reed hut to him Enki applied the healing.In his reed hut Alalu was sitting, spittle he spat from his mouth;In his innards the malehood of Anu was like a burden,With Anu's semen were his innards impregnated; like a female in travail his belly grew swollen. On the third day Anu's pains subsided; his pride was greatly hurting.To Nibiru I wish to return! to his two sons did Anu say.Beforehand upon Alalu there must be a judgment; a sentence the crime befitting must be imposed!By the laws of Nibiru seven judges were required, the highest of rank on them to preside. In the square of Eridu the heroes were assembled the trial of Alalu to observe.70
