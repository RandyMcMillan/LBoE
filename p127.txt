By the proliferation of the Earthlings, what by itself was growing for all insufficient was;In three more Shars of fish and fowl there was a shortage, what by itself grows Anunnaki and Earthlings did not satiate.In his heart, Enki a new undertaking was scheming; to create a Civilized Mankind in his heart he conceived.Grains that are sown by them to be cultivated, ewes that become sheep let them shepherd! In his heart Enki a new undertaking was scheming; how this to attain he contemplated. The Primitive Workers in the Abzu he for this scheme observed,The Earthlings in the Edin, in the cities and in the orchards he considered.What could for the tasks make them suited? What by the life essence has not been combined? The offspring of the Earthlings he observed, an alarming matter he noticed:By their repeated copulations, back toward their wild forebears they were degraded!Enki in the marshlands looked about, on the rivers he sailed and observed;With him was only Isimud, his vizier, who secrets kept.On the river's bank, bathing and frolicking Earthlings he noticed;Two females among them were wild with beauty, firm were their breasts.Their sight the phallus of Enki caused to water, a burning desire he had.Shall I not kiss the young ones? Enki his vizier Isimud was asking.I the boat will hither row, kiss the young ones! Isimud to Enki was saying.The boat thereto Isimud directed, from the boat to dry land Enki stepped.A young one to him Enki called, a tree fruit she to him offered.Enki bent down, the young one lie embraced, on her lips he kissed her;Sweet were her lips, firm with ripeness were her breasts.Into her womb he poured his semen, in a mating he knew her.Into her womb she took the holy semen, by the semen of the lord Enki she was impregnated.127
