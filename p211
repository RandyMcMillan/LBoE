Pour for her cold water to freshen her heart, barley cakes with butter give her, Sweet wine prepare, the beer vessels to the rim fill up!When Inanna alone the abode of Enki entered, Isimud Enki's commands followed; Then when Enki Inanna greeted, by Inanna's beauty he was overwhelmed:With jewelry was Inanna bedecked, by her thin dress her body she revealed;When she bent down, her vulva by Enki was thoroughly admired.From the wine cups sweet wine they drank, for beer drinking a competition they had.Show me the ME's, Inanna to Enki playfully said; let me ME in my hand hold!Seven, times in the course of the competition Enki to Inanna ME's to hold gave,The divine formulas for lordship and kingship, for priesthood and scribeship,For lovedressing and for warring ME's to Inanna Enki to hold gave;For music and singing, woodworking and metals and precious stones,Ninety-four ME's that for civilized kingdoms are needed Enki to Inanna gave.Holding her prizes tightly, Inanna from the slumbering Enki slipped away;To her Boat of Heaven she rushed out, to soar away her pilot she instructed.When Enki from his slumber by Isimud was awakened, Get hold of Inanna! to Isimud he said.When from Isimud that Inanna had already in her Boat of Heaven departed Enki heard,To chase Inanna in Enki's skyship Isimud he instructed. All the ME's you must retrieve! to him he said.At the approach to Unug-ki Isimud Ianna's Boat of Heaven intercepted,To return to Eridu and the wrath of Enki face he made her.But when Inanna back to Eridu was brought, the ME's with her no more were:To her chambermaid, Ninshubur, she gave them, to the House of Anu in Unug-ki Ninshubur took them.In the name of my power, in the name of my father Anu, I command you the ME's to return!211
