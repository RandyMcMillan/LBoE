Let the place be scorched to oblivion! Ninurta shouted; the One Who Scorches let me be!Excited, Nergal stood up and shouted: Let the evildoers' cities also be upheavaled,The sinning cities let me obliterate, let the Annihilator my name thereafter be!The Earthlings, by us created, must not be harmed; the righteous with the sinners must not be perished, I forcefully said.Ninharsag, my creating helpmate, was consenting: The matter is between the gods alone to settle, the people must not be harmed.Anu, from the celestial abode, to the discussions was giving much heed. Anu, who determines fates, from his celestial abode his voice made heard:Let the Weapons of Terror be this once used, let the place of the rocketships be obliterated, let the people be spared.Let Ninurta the Scorcher be, let Nergal be the Annihilator! So did Enlil the decision announce.To them, a secret of the gods I shall reveal; the hiding place of the terror weapons to them I shall disclose.The two sons, one mine, one his, to his inner chamber Enlil summoned. Nergal, as he went by me, his gaze averted.Alas! I cried out without words; brother has turned against brother! Are the Prior Times fated to repeat?A secret from the Olden Times to them Enlil was revealing, the Weapons of Terror to their hands entrusting!Clad with terror, with a brilliance they are unleashed; all they touch to a dust heap they turn.For brother against brother on Earth they were foresworn, neither region to affect.Now the oath was undone, like a broken jar in useless pieces.The two sons, full of glee, with quickened step from Enlil's chamber emerged, for the weapons departing.The other gods turned back to their cities; none of his own calamity had a foreboding! Now this is the account of the Prior Times, and of the Weapons of Terror.14
