Gilgamesh, having by Ninsun and Utu been instructed, of the slaying was absolved.Still the long life of Nibiru seeking, Gilgamesh to proceed to the Place of the Chariots by Utu was permitted.After many adventures the Land of Tilmun, the Fourth Region, he reached;Through its subterranean tunnels he proceeded, in a garden of precious stones Ziusudra he met!The events of the Deluge Ziusudra to Gilgamesh related, the secret of long living to Gilgamesh he revealed:A plant in the garden's well was growing, Ziusudra and his spouse from getting old it prevented! Unique of all the plants on Earth it was; by it a man full vigor can regain.Man at Old Age Is Young Again! This is the plant's name, Ziusudra to Gilgamesh said.A gift of Enki, with Enlil's blessing, on the Mount of Salvation to us was grantedlWhen Ziusudra and his spouse were asleep, Gilgamesh to his feet stones tied.Into the well he dived, the plant of Being Young Again he grasped and uprooted.With the plant in his satchel through the tunnels he hurried, to Unug-ki he made his way. When he tired and was asleep, a snake by the plant's fragrance was attracted.The plant did the snake snatch from the sleeping Gilgamesh; with the plant it vanished. In the morning, his loss discovering, Gilgamesh sat and wept.To Unug-ki empty-handed he returned, as a mortal therein he died.Seven more kings in Unug-ki after Gilgamesh reigned, then its kingship to an end came; Precisely when the count of a thousand Earth years was completed it was!To Urim, the city of Nannar and Ningal, was kingship of the First Region transferred.To all these matters that in the other Regions were occurring, Marduk much heed gave. By Inanna's dreams and visions, to Dumuzi's domain alluding, Ra was disturbed.To counteract Inanna's schemes of expansions he was determined;In the matters of resurrection and immortality he found much to ponder.221
