And how by Nibiru the Shars were counted, and how the counts by Enki were combined,How the lord Enki the circle of the heavens to twelve parts divided,A constellation to each one how Enki assigned, twelve stations in a grand circle he arranged,How to honor the twelve Anunnaki great leaders by names the stations were called.To explore the heavens Enkime was eager; two celestial journeys he did make.And this is the account of Enkime's journeys to the heavens,And how the Igigi troubles and intermarriages by Marduk were started.To be with Marduk in the Landing Place Enkime was sent,From there Marduk in a rocketship to the Moon did him take.There what Marduk from his father Enki had learned to Enkime he did teach.When to Earth Enkime returned, to be with Utu in Sippar, the Place of the Chariots, he was sent.There a tablet for writing what he was learning by Utu to Enkime was given, Utu in his bright abode a Prince of Earthlings him installed.The rites him he taught, the functions of priesthood to begin.In Sippar with his spouse Edinni, a half sister, Enkime resided,To them in the one hundred and fourth Shar a son was born,Matushal his mother him named, Who by the Bright Waters Raised the name meant.It was after that that Enkime on his second journey to the heavens went,This time too Marduk was his mentor and companion.In a celestial chariot heavenward they soared, toward the Sun and away from it they circled. To visit the Igigi on Lahmu by Marduk he was taken,To him the Igigi a liking took, of Civilized Earthlings from him they learned.Of him it is in the Annals said that to the heavens he departed,That in the heavens he stayed till the end of his days.145
